# Category Theory

These are a set of notes on category theory I worked on for the latter two years as an undegraduate.

Category Theory is a very beautiful area of mathematics 
that unites different areas of mathematics, in particular algebra and topology. 
The field attempts to discover patterns and relationships between 
seemingly different mathematical constructions, and it came about as a field when 
algebraic topologists wanted to associate topological spaces with 
algebraic groups, since this was useful, but they had no formal 
way of describing this process.

My goal with these notes was to read most of the classic texts in category theory and 
then find the most intuitive way to explain the concepts that I learned for the 
benefit of others. Many category theory texts are often quite cryptic and terse, 
and I figured I could save people some time in understanding these concepts with these notes. 

I relied heavily on *Categories for the Working Mathematician*, the de facto category theory text 
which is great but is extremely terse and challenging.
