#1.11. Initial, Terminal, and Zero Objects
We can also be more specific in discussing the nature of the
objects of a given category $\cc$.


<span style="display:block" class="definition">
Let the following objects exist in some category $\cc$. 

*  Let $T$ be an object. Then $T$
is **terminal** if for each object $A$, there
exists exactly one morphism $f_A$ such that $f_A:
A \to T$. 



*  Let $I$ be an object. Then $I$ is said to be
**initial** if for each object $A$ there exists
exactly one 
morphism $f_A : I \to A$. 



*  An object $Z$ is said to be a **zero object**
if it is both terminal and initial. Since terminal and initial objects 
are unique, so is a zero object.

Equivalently, it is
zero if for any objects $A, B$, there exists exactly one
morphism $f: A \to Z$ and exactly one morphism $g: Z  \to
B$. Hence, for any two objects there exists a morphism between them,
namely given by
by $g \circ f$, called the **zero morphism** from $A$ 
to $B$. 



If an object $T$ is terminal, then there is one and only
morphism to itself (namely, its identity). Therefore,
for any two terminal objects $T$ and $T'$, they are
isomorphic, since by assumption there exists unique morphisms
$f: T \to T'$ and $g: T' \to T$ and we have no choice but to
say 

\[
f \circ g = 1_T \quad g \circ f = 1_{T'}.
\]

Recall that in the category $\grp$, there exists a trivial group 
$\{e\}$. Moreover, for each group $G$, there exist unique group homomorphisms 

\[
i_G: \{e\} \to G \qquad e \mapsto e_G 
\]

and 

\[
t_G: G \to \{e\} \qquad g \mapsto e_G.
\]

Note that both are group homomorphisms since they both behave on identity elements 
and are trivially distributive across group operations. This then shows that 
$\grp$, the trivial group is initial and terminal and hence a zero object. 

This makes sense since for any two groups $G, H$, there exists a unique map 

\[
z: G \to H \qquad g \mapsto e_H
\]

which could be factorized as 

<img src="../../png/chapter_1/section_11_figure_0.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
which demonstrates the existence of a zero object (the name "zero" makes sense now, right?), 
which we already know is $\{e\}$.
Note in this example, we did not actually use much group theory. In fact, this could be repeated 
for the categories $R\mod$, $\ab$, and other similar categories.

The next two examples demonstrate that terminal and initial objects of course don't 
always have to coincide like they did in the previous example. 


<span style="display:block" class="example">
Let $n$ be a positive integer. Recall that we can create a category, specifically a 
preorder, by taking our objects to be positive integers less than $n$, 
and allowing one morphism $f: k \to m$ whenever $k \le m$.
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_1/section_11_figure_1.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
Then 1 is an initial object while $n$ is a terminal object. This 
is because for any number $1 \le m \le n$, there exists a unique morphism 
from $1$ to $m$, and a unique morphism $m$ to $n$, both which may 
be obtained by repeated composition.

<span style="display:block" class="example">
Consider the category $\Set$. Let $X$ be a given set in this category. 
Then there are two unique functions which we may construct. First, there is the function 

\[
t_X: X \to \{\bullet\}
\]

where everything in $X$ is mapped to the one element $\bullet$ of the one point set. 
Secondly, we may construct a function whose domain is the empty set, 
and whose codomain is $X$, as below.

\[
i_X: \varnothing \to X
\]

Thus we have that, in $\Set$, the one point set is a terminal 
object $\{\bullet\}$ while the empty set
$\varnothing$ is an initial object.

One may wonder at this point: How exactly is $i_X$ a true, set theoretic function?
And why can't we also obtain a unique morphism $i'_X: X \to \varnothing$, 
so that $\varnothing$ is a terminal object as well?

The second question is easy to answer; if $\varnothing$ was also terminal, then 
we'd have that $\{\bullet\} \cong \varnothing$ which is not true. Since this is a bit of a boring 
answer, we'll explain in detail.

Recall that a function in $f: A \to X$ between two sets $A$ and 
$X$ is a relation $R \subset A \times X$ which satisfies two properties. 

* [1.] (Existence.) For each $a \in A$, there exists a
$x \in X$ such that $(a, x) \in R$ 


* [2.] (Uniqueness. Or, if you'd like, the vertical line test.) 
If $(a, x) \in R$ and $(a, x') \in R$ then $x = x'$. 



Now observe that if $A = \varnothing$, then $R \subset \varnothing \times X = \varnothing$. 
Hence (1) and (2) are satisfied because each is trivially true. However, we don't get 
a function $f: X \to \varnothing$, since in this case (1) fails. Specifically, (1) demands 
the existence of elements in our codomain, a demand we cannot meet if it is empty. 

Thus we see that $\varnothing$ is initial, but not terminal as our intuition may suggest, 
and that $\{\bullet\}$ is terminal.

<span style="display:block" class="example">
Consider the category of fields $\fld$. Suppose we ask if this has an initial 
or terminal object. 

We might guess that the smallest field 

\[
\mathbb{F}_2 \cong (\zz/2\zz, +, \cdot) = \{0, 1\} 
\]

which has characteristic 2 is an initial object. However, this fails to be initial. 
Observe that the only homomorphism between $\mathbb{F}_2$ and $\mathbb{F}_3$ is the zero 
homomorphism, which is not in our category. (Recall that $\fld$ is a full subcategory 
of $\ring$, a category whose morphisms we require to be unit preserving.)

The reason why it must be the zero homomorphisms is because $\mathbb{F}_3$ has characteristic three, 
and in general, two fields will only share a (nonzero) field homomorphisms if they 
have the same characteristic. 

By a similar argument, we can state that terminal objects also do no exist. Overall, 
these objects fail to exist in $\fld$ because fields have a large set of 
restictions imposed by their numerous axioms.
Hence, this category lacks initial and terminal objects.

* [**1.**] 
\begin{itemize}


* [(*i*.)] Let $\cc$ be a category with initial object $I$. 
For any two objects $A, B \in \cc$, define for each $f \in \hom_{\cc}(A, B)$
the functor

\[
P_f: **2** \to \cc
\]

such that $P(\textcolor{NavyBlue}{\bullet}) = A$, $P(\textcolor{Orange}{\bullet}) = B$, 
and $P_f(\textcolor{NavyBlue}{\bullet} \to \textcolor{Orange}{\bullet}) = f: A \to B$. 
Show that for each $f: A \to B$ in $\cc$, we have a natural transformation 

\[
\eta: P_{1_I} \to P_f.
\]

Note that $1_I: I \to I$ is the identity on the initial object.


* [(*ii*.)]
Suppose we don't know if $\cc$ has an initial object, 
but we have a distinguished object 
$I'$ with the property that for each $f \in \hom_{\cc}(A,B)$ there is a natural 
transformation 

\[
\eta: P_{1_{I'}} \to P_f.
\]

Is $I'$ an inital object?



* [(*iii*.)] Dualize your work for terminal objects.\\
(*Hint*: We now want a natural transformation $\eta': P_f \to P_{1_I})$.
