#2.3. Functor Categories
In the proof for the last proposition, we used a trick of forming
a desired natural transformation by composing two composable
natural transformations. Hence, we see that natural
transformations can be "composed." We refine this notion as follows.

Let $\cc$ and $\dd$ be categories and consider three functors
$F, G, H: \cc \to \dd$.
Suppose further that we have two natural transformations $\sigma, \tau$ as below:

(This might seem like a weird way to write this, but we are trying to hint at something.)
Using these two natural transformations,
we can define a natural transformation 

\[
\tau \cdot \sigma: F \to H
\]

where, for each $C \in \cc$, we define 

\[
(\tau \cdot \sigma)_C = \tau_C \circ \sigma_C: F(C) \to H(C).
\]

Visually, we can picture what we are doing as follows.
For a given morphism $f: A \to B$ in $\cc$,
we define the morphism $(\tau \cdot \sigma)_C$ as
\

Thus, we see that natural transformations can be "composed,"
and we can thus ask: If we view functors as objects, and view natural transformations 
as morphisms, do we get a category? The answer is yes.

Let $\cc$ and $\dd$ be small categories and consider set of
all functors $F: \cc \to \dd$. Then the \textbf{functor
category}, denoted as $\dd^\cc$ or $\fun(\cc, \dd)$, is the
category where 
\begin{description}
\item[Objects.] Functors $F: \cc \to \dd$
\item[Morphisms.] Natural transformations $\eta: F \to G$   
\end{description}

Functor categories are extremely useful, as we shall see that 
they're the categorical version of representations. 

When we think of 
representations, we usually think of a group homomorphism $\rho: G \to \text{GL}_n(V)$ 
for some vector space $V$ over a field $k$. However, suppose we wanted to be 
a real smart-ass and say ``Well, can't we regard $\rho$ as actually a functor 
between two one-object categories whose morphisms are all isomorphism?''
The answer is yes! 

What this then means is that the category of representations of a group $G$
is actually a functor category. Specifically, 

\[
\fun(G, \text{GL}_n(V)) \cong R**-Mod**.
\]

Hence in some cases it helps to think of $\fun(\cc, \dd)$ as a 
category of representations of $\cc$. This makes sense, since that is really 
what a functor is. A functor preserves composition; and if we stop thinking 
like the set theorists, we can realize that composition controls a great deal 
of structure 
in a category $\cc$. Hence a functor $F: \cc \to \dd$ ``represents"" that structure in a 
category $\dd$. 


<span style="display:block" class="example">
Let $\bm{1}$ be the one element category with a
single identity arrow. Then for any category $\cc$, the
functor category $\cc^{\bm{1}}$ is isomorphic to $\cc$. This
is because each functor $F: \bm{1} \to \cc$ simply associates
the element $1 \in \bm{1}$ to an element $C \in \cc$, and the
identity $1_1: 1 \to 1$ to the identity morphism $1_C$ in
$\cc$. 
</span>


<span style="display:block" class="example">
Let $\bm{2}$ be the category consisting of two
elements, containing the two identities and one nontrivial
morphism between the objects. 
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_3_figure_2.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
Now consider the functor category $\cc^{\bm{2}}$ where $\cc$ is
any category. Each functor $F:\bm{2} \to \cc$ maps the pair of
objects to objects $F(1)$ and $F(2)$ in $\cc$. However, since
functors preserve morphisms, we see that 

\[ 
f: 1 \to 2 \implies F(f): F(1) \to F(2).
\]

This is what each $F \in \cc^{\bm{2}}$ does. Hence, every
morphism $g \in \hom(\cc)$ corresponds to an element in
$\cc^{\bm{2}}$. Hence, we call $\cc^{\bm{2}}$ the category of
arrows of $\cc$. 

<span style="display:block" class="proof">
Let $g: C \to C'$ be any morphism between objects $C, C'$
in $\cc$. Construct the element $G \in
\cc^{\bm{2}}$ as follows:
$G(1) = C$, $G(2) = C'$ and $G(f) : G(1) \to G(2) = g$.
Hence, $\hom(\cc)$ and $\cc^{\bm{2}}$ are isomorphic.
Moreover, $\hom(\cc)$ determines the members of
$\cc^{\bm{2}}$. 

A crude way to visualize this proof is
imaging $1 \to 2$ is a "stick" with 1 and 2 on either end,
and so the action of any functor is simply taking the
stick and applying it  to anywhere on the direct graph
generated by the category $\cc$. Hence, this is why we say
$\hom(\cc)$ determines the functor category $\cc^{\bm{2}}$.

Let $X$ be a set. Hence, it is a discrete category,
which if recall, it's objects are elements of $X$ and the
morphisms are just identity morphisms. 

Now consider $\{0, 1\}^X$, the category of functors $F: X \to
\{0, 1\}$. Then every functor assigns each element of $x \in
X$ to either $0$ or $1$, and assigns the morphism $1_x: x \to
x$ to either $1_0: 0\to 0$ or $1_1: 1 \to 1$. 

One way to view this is to consider $\mathcal{P}(X)$, and for
each $S \in \mathcal{P}$, assign $x$ to $1$ if $x \in  S$ or
$x$ to $0$ if $x \not\in S$. All of these mappings may be
described by elements of $\mathcal{P}$, but we can also
realize that each 
of these mappings correspond to the functors in $\{0, 1\}^X$.
Hence, we see that $\{0, 1\}^X$ is isomorphic to
$\mathcal{P}(X)$.

Recall from Example \ref{group_ring_functors} that, given 
a group $G$ and a ring $R$ (with identity), we can create a 
*group ring* $R[G]$ with identity, in a functorial way, establishing 
a functor 

\[
R[-]: **Grp** \to **Ring**.
\]

However, we then noticed that the above functor establishes a process 
where we send rings $R$ to functors $R[-]: **Grp** \to **Ring**$. 
It turns out that this process is itself a functor, and we now 
have the appropriate language to describe it:

\[
F: **Ring** \to **Ring**^{**Grp**}
\]

Specifically, let $\psi: R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism. 
Now observe that $\psi$ induces another ring homomorphism 

\[
\psi_G^*: R[G] \to S[G] \qquad \sum_{g \in G}a_g g \mapsto \sum_{g \in G}\phi(a_g) g.
\]

As a result, we see that such a ring homomorphism induces a natural transformation.
To show this, let $\phi: G \to H$ be a group homomorphism. Then observe that
we get the diagram in the middle. 
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_3_figure_3.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
However, we can follow the elements as in the diagram on the right, which shows 
us that the diagram commutes. Hence we see that $\psi^*$ is a natural transformation 
between functors $R[-] \to S[-]$. Overall, this establishes that we do in fact have 
a functor 

\[
F: **Ring** \to **Ring**^{**Grp**}   
\]

which we wouldn't be able to describe without otherwise introducing 
the notion of a functor category.

Let $M$ be a monoid category (one object) and
consider the functor category $**Set**^M$. The objects of
**Set**$^M$ are functors $F: M \to **Set**$, each
of which have the following data: 

\[
F(f) : F(M) \to F(M)
\]

where $f: M \to M$ is an morphism in $M$. Now if we interpret
$\circ$ as the binary relation equipped on $M$, we see that
for any $g : M \to M$,

\[
F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)
\]

by functorial properties. Hence, each functor $F$ maps $M$ to
a set $X$ which induces the operation of $M$ on $X$. Therefore
the objects of **Set**$^M$ are other monoids $X$ in
**Set** equipped with the same operation as $M$ and as
well as the morphisms between such monoids.
