#2.6. Graphs, Quivers and Free Categories
In studying category it is often helpful to imagine the objects
and morphisms in action as vertices and edges corresponding to a
graph. In fact, such a pictorial representation of a category is
not even incorrect; one can pass categories and graphs from one to
the other. To speak of this, we first review some terminology.


<span style="display:block" class="definition">
A (small) **graph** $G$ is a set of vertices $V(G)$ and a set 
edges $E(G)$ such that there exists an assignment function

\[
\partial: E(G) \to V(G)\times V(G)
\]

which assigns every edge to the ordered pair containing its endpoints.

On the other hand, a **directed graph** is a graph $G$ 
where $E(G)$ is now a set of 2-tuples $(v_1, v_2)$. This allows 
each edge of $E(G)$ to have a specified direction. In this case, 
the assignment function has the form $\partial: E(G) \to V(G)$. 
</span>
Now, how do we formulate a morphism between two graphs? 


<span style="display:block" class="definition">
A **graph homomorphism** between two graphs $G$ and $H$ is a 
function $f: G \to H$ which induces maps $f_V: V(G) \to V(H)$ and
$f_E: E(G) \to E(H)$ where if $\partial(e) = (v_1, v_2)$, then  

\[
\partial \circ f_E(e) = (f_V(v_1), f_V(v_2)).
\]

</span>

In some sense, this behaves almost like a functor. This observation 
will become important later. 
Now since we have a consistent way to speak of graphs and their
morphisms, we can form the category **Grph** where the
objects are small graphs and the morphisms are graph morphisms as
described above. 

Finally we introduce the concept of a quiver, which we will 
see is basically the skeleton of a category. 


<span style="display:block" class="definition">
A **quiver** is a directed graph $G$ which allows multiple edges 
between vertices. Instead of a function $\partial$, a quiver is equipped with 
**source** and **target** functions 

\[
s: E(G) \to V(G) \qquad t: E(G) \to V(G).
\]

So a quiver is a 4-tuple $(E(G), V(G), s, t)$.
Now as before, a **morphism** $f: Q \to Q'$ between quivers $(E(Q), V(Q), s, t)$ and 
$(E(Q'), V(Q'), s', t')$ is one which preserves edge-vertex
relations. Thus, it is a pair of functions $f_E: E(Q) \to E(Q')$ 
and $f_V: V(Q) \to V(Q)'$ such that 

\[
f_V \circ s = s' \circ f_E \qquad f_V \circ t = t' \circ f_E.
\]

</span>

\noindent Now that we have all of those definitions out of the way, what's really going 
on here? A quiver can be abstracted as a pair of objects and morphisms.
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_2.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
If we let $C\op$ be the category with two objects, two nontrivial morphisms 
and two identity morphisms as below
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_3.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
then we see that a **quiver is a functor** $F: \cc\op \to **Set**$. 
With that said, 
we can define the **category of quivers Quiv**, which, based on what we just showed, 
is a functor category with objects $F: \cc\op \to **Set**$. This 
allows us to interpret quiver homomorphisms as natural transformations.

\textcolor{MidnightBlue}{Now why on earth do we care about these things called quivers?}
The reason is because the underlying structure of small categories 
take the form of a quiver. For example, the category on the left below 
can be turned into a quiver, as on the right, after "forgetting" composition and identity 
morphisms. 
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_4.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
In general, since categories allow multiple arrows between objects, 
we can construct a forgetful functor which forgets composition 
and identity arrows.

\[
U: **Cat** \to **Quiv**.
\]

Note that if $F : \cc \to \cc'$ is a functor then $U(F)
: U(\cc) \to U(\cc')$ is in fact a well-behaved morphism between
two quivers. \textcolor{NavyBlue}{Recall that the construction of a
graph homomorphism is basically a functor as we've known to so far}. 

Not only can we forget categories to generate quivers, we can generate 
categories using the skeletal structure of a quiver. This leads to the concept 
of a **free category**; the concept is no different than the concept 
of, say, a free group generated by a set $X$. 


<span style="display:block" class="definition">
Let $Q$ be a quiver with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. 
We define the **free category generated by $Q$** as 
the category with 
\begin{description}
\item[Objects.] The set $V$ 
\item[Morphisms.] The **paths** of the quiver.   
\end{description}
Precisely, a **path** is any sequence of edges and vertices 
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_5.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
with composition of paths defined in the intuitive way: 
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_6.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_7.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
When we generate the free category, we also remember to add identity arrows to 
each vertex. 
</span>

Since for each quiver $Q$, we can define a free category $F_C(Q)$ on $Q$, 
we can realize that this mapping is functorial. That is,  we can define a
functor 

\[ 
F_C: **Quiv** \to **Cat**
\]

where it maps on objects and morphisms as
\begin{statement}{Red!10}
\begin{align_topbot}
Q &\longmapsto F_C(Q)\\
(f: Q \to Q') &\longmapsto (F_C(f): F_C(Q') \to F_C(Q)).
\end{align_topbot}
\end{statement}
That is, quiver homomorphisms can map to functors $F_C(f)$ between the free categories
generated by the respective quivers. 

Now, what is the relationship between a quiver $Q$ and the quiver $U(F_C(Q))$? 
There must exist an injection $i: Q \to U(F(Q))$ which sends $Q$ to the skeleton 
of $U(F_C(Q))$. It turns out that this morphism is universal from $Q$ to $U$. 



<span style="display:block" class="theorem">
Let $Q$ be a quiver. Then there is a graph homomorphism $i: Q \to U(F_C(Q))$ 
such that, for any other graph homomorphism
$\phi: Q \to U(\cc)$ with $\cc$ a category, there exists a unique
functor $F: F_C(Q) \to \cc$ where $U(F) \circ i = \phi$. That is,
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_8.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
</span>
This is an example of a universal arrow; the dotted lines are the
morphisms which are forced to exist by the conditions of the
diagram, which is the idea of a universal element.


<span style="display:block" class="proof">
Denote each morphism or path in $F_C(Q)$ of length $n$
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_9.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
as $(v_0, e_0e_1\cdots e_{n-1}, v_n): v_0 \to v_n$. Now define the inclusion 
$i: Q \to U(F_C(Q))$ where each vertex and edge is sent identically. That is, vertices 
$v$ map to $v$ in $F_C(Q)$,  and morphisms are sent identically and for each 
edge $e: v \to v'$:

\[
i(e: v \to v') = (v, e, v').
\]

An important observation to make is the fact that every morphism $(v_0, e_0e_1\cdots e_{n-1}, v_n): v_0 \to v_n)$
in $F_C(Q)$ is a composition of length 2-morphism: 
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_10.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
\
<img src="../../png/chapter_2/section_6_figure_11.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
Therefore, for any graph homomorphism $\phi: Q \to U(\cc)$, 
we can create a unique functor $F: F_C(Q) \to \cc$ where 

\begin{align*}
v &\longmapsto \phi(v)\\
(v_0, e_0e_1\cdots e_{n-1}, v_n): v_0 \to v_n &\longmapsto 
\phi(e_0:  v_0 \to v_1) \circ \phi(e_1: v_1 \to v_2)
\circ \cdots \circ \phi(e_{n-1}: v_{n-1} \to v_n)
\end{align*}

which then gives us 

\begin{align*}
U(F) \circ i = \phi
\end{align*}

as desired.
