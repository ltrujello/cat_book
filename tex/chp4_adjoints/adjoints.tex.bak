\chapter{Adjoints.}

\section{Adjuncitons.}

Let $J$ be an indexing category (simply, any category which we will use to 
index things), $\cc$ a category, and suppose that 
each functor $F: J \to \cc$ has a limit $\Lim F$ in $\cc$. Then what 
we can do with this is 
define the functor $\Lim: \cc^J \to \cc$ where the functor sends 
functor $F: J \to \cc$ to their limits:
\[
    F: J \to C \mapsto  \Lim F.
\]
Why is this functorial? Well, suppose $\theta: F \to G$ is a morphism (natural 
transformation) between two functors $F, G: J \to \cc$ in $\cc^J$. 
Recall that $\Delta: \cc \to \cc^J$ is the diagonal functor.
Then, as limits, 
they have natural transformations 
\[
    \epsilon_F: \Delta(\Lim F) \to F \qquad \epsilon_G: \Delta(\Lim G) \to G
\] 
which are equipped with the universal property expressed in the 
diagrams below.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
        \Delta(\Lim F) \arrow[r, "\epsilon_F"] 
        &
        F\\
        \arrow[u, dashed, "u"]
        \Delta(C)\arrow[ur, swap, "f"]
    \end{tikzcd}
    \hspace{1cm}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
        \Delta(\Lim G) \arrow[r, "\epsilon_G"] 
        &
        G\\
        \arrow[u, dashed, "v"]
        \Delta(D)\arrow[ur, swap, "g"]
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $C, D$ are objects of $\cc$ and $f, g$ are morphisms in $\cc^J$. 
Then observe that we can connect these diagrams: 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
        \Delta(\Lim G) 
        \arrow[r, "v"]
        &
        G\\
        \Delta(\Lim F)
        \arrow[u, dashed, "h"]
        \arrow[ur, swap, "\theta \circ \epsilon_F"]
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
which forces the unique existence of a morphism (natural transformation) 
$h: \Delta(\Lim F) \to \Delta(\Lim G)$ in $\cc^J$. If we set $F(\theta) = h$, 
then we see that this behavior is functorial. The other trivial properties are simple to check. 

\textcolor{NavyBlue}{So, what's the big deal about the limit $\Lim $of a functor actually being a secret 
functor whenever all limits are admitted?}

First, the fact that it is a functor means we have a truly remarkable relationship between 
the functors 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
        \cc^J \arrow[r, shift right = 0.5ex, swap, "\Lim "] 
        &
        \cc 
        \arrow[l, shift left = -0.5ex, swap, "\Delta"]
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Now to really see the significance, let's reinterpret what it means for a functor $F: J \to \cc$ to 
have a limit in $\cc$. It means that the diagram below 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
        \Delta(\Lim F) \arrow[r, "\epsilon_F"] 
        &
        F\\
        \arrow[u, dashed, "u"]
        \Delta(C)\arrow[ur, swap, "f"]
        &
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
commutes. Specifically, whenever we have a morphism $f: \Delta(C) \to F$ in $\cc^J$, there 
exists a unique morphism $u: C \to \Lim F$. 
This is old news. However, an equivalent way to interpret this result is to observe 
that it also is communicating to us a bijection
\begin{statement}{ProcessBlue!10}
    \begin{equation}\label{lim_delta_adjoints}
       \hom_{\cc^J}(\Delta(C), F) \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, \Lim F).
    \end{equation}
\end{statement}
which is given by some bijection $\phi_{C, F}$. Moreover, this bijection is actually natural in
each object, but we won't worry about that for now. The point here is that we call 
the above relation between functors, equipped with the above natural bijection, an
\textbf{adjunction}.
\\

The above result can be applied for 
all kinds of limits; and the beauty of it is that it captures the individual philosophy 
of each individual limit. 
For example, when $J$ is discrete, the limit 
becomes a product. Specifically, our functors reduce to the relation 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
        \prod_{j \in J}\cc \arrow[r, shift right = 0.5ex, swap, "P"] 
        &
        \cc 
        \arrow[l, shift left = -0.5ex, swap, "\Delta"]
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $\prod_{j \in J}\cc$ is product category, and
we define $P$ to act on the product category as
\[
    (A_j)_{j \in J} \mapsto \prod_{i \in J}A_i
    \quad 
\]  
(hence, $P$ for "product")
where $(A_j)_{j \in J}$ denotes a "tuple" of elements,
and the diagonal functor behaves as
\[
    A \mapsto (A_j)_{j \in J} \text{ where } A_j = A \text{ for  all j}.
\]
Then from our previous work we automatically get the natural bijection 
between hom-sets
\[
    \hom_{\prod_{j \in J}\cc}\Big((A)_{j \in J}, (C_j)_{j \in J}\Big) 
    \cong 
    \hom_{\cc}\left(A, \prod_{j \in J} C_j\right).
\]
The above bijection actually makes a lot of sense; it says that if you have a family of morphisms 
into the factors $(C_j)_{j \in J}$ of a product $\prod_{j \in J} C_j$, 
then you get a unique morphism into the product of those factors, 
which is \emph{exactly} the universal property of products! 

As another example, suppose $J$ is the category
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        1
        \arrow[r, shift right = 0.5ex, swap, "g"]
        \arrow[r, shift left = 0.5ex, "f"]
        &
        2
    \end{tikzcd}.
\end{center}
Then the limit of a functor $F: J \to \cc$ (when it exists) is an equalizer
of the morphisms $f' = F(f)$ and $g' = G(f)$. 
The diagram below expresses the universal property.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
        \text{Eq}(f', g') 
        \arrow[r, "e"]
        &
        F(1)
        \arrow[r, shift right = 0.5ex, swap, "g'"]
        \arrow[r, shift left = 0.5ex, "f'"]
        &
        F(2)\\
        C \arrow[u, dashed, "u"]
        \arrow[ur, swap, "h"]
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $f' \circ e = g' \circ e$ and  $f' \circ h = g' \circ h$. 
Now because 
\[
    \hom_{\cc^{J}}(\Delta(C), F)
    = 
    \{ h: C \to F(1) \mid f' \circ h = g' \circ h  \}
\]
we see that
relation \ref{lim_delta_adjoints} gives us 
\[
    \hom_{\cc^{J}}(\Delta(C), F) = \{ h: C \to F(1) \mid f' \circ h = g' \circ h  \} 
    \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, \text{Eq}(f',g')).
\]
This is just a different way of stating the exact concept of an equalizer!

The general formula we produced cleverly
offers clarity of limits from a different perspective, one which we wouldn't normally 
envision ourselves (a fact that Saunder Mac Lane believes as to why it took so long for adjoints to be 
defined). 

Adjunctions, which are beautiful correspondences between pairs of functors such at $\Lim$ and $\Delta$
are abundant in math, and we now define them generally.

% Consider again the example we introduced in the previous section, in
% which we considered two functors between the categories \textbf{Set}
% and $\textbf{Vct}_K$. Let $U: \textbf{Vct}_K \to \textbf{Set}$ be the
% natural forgetful functor, and let $V: \textbf{Set} \to
% \textbf{Vct}_K$ which assigns as set $X$ to a vector space $V(X)$ with
% basis elements in $X$. 

% Now consider a morphism $g: X \to U(W)$ for some set $X$ and vector
% space $W$. Then this extends to a morphism $f: V(X) \to W$ in
% $\textbf{Vct}_K$, where 
% \[
%     f\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n}k_ix_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}k_ig(x_i) \in W.
% \]
% As $f$ is defined in terms of $g$, we know that this correspondence $g
% \mapsto f$ is unique. 

% On the other hand, consider a linear transformation $f: V(X) \to W$.
% Then if we restruct $f$ to $X$, we see that 
% \[
%     f\big|_X : X \to W
% \]
% which we can interpret as a morphism $g: X \to U(W)$. Hence this
% correspondence goes both ways, and we have a bijection of sets 
% \[
%     \textbf{Vct}_K(V(X), W) \cong \textbf{Set}(X, U(W)).
% \]
% and we denote this bijection as $\phi_{X, W}: \textbf{Vct}_K(V(X), W) \cong
% \textbf{Set}(X, U(W))$. This then extends itself into a natural
% transformation; that is, if $h: X' \to X$, then
% \begin{center}
%     \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
%         \textbf{Vct}_K(V(X), W) \arrow[r, "\phi"]
%         \arrow[d, swap, "(Vh)^*"]
%         &
%         \textbf{Set}(X, U(W))\arrow[d, "h^*"]\\
%         \textbf{Vct}_K(V(X'), W) \arrow[r, "\phi"]
%         &
%         \textbf{Set}(X', U(W))
%     \end{tikzcd}
% \end{center}
% is commutative, where $(Vh)^{*}(f: V(X) \to W) = f \circ V(h)$ and
% $h^{*}(g: X \to U(W)) = g \circ h$. 

\begin{definition}
    Let $\cc$ and $\dd$ be categories. We say an \textbf{adjunction}
    $(F, G,\phi)$ is a pair of functors 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            \cc \arrow[r, shift left=0.6ex,"F"] & \dd 
            \arrow[l,shift right =-0.6ex, "G"]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    and a bijection $\phi_{C,D}$ which assigns each pair of objects
    $C, D$ a bijection of sets
    \[
        \phi(C, D) \mapsto \phi_{C, D}: \hom_\dd(F(C), D) \cong \hom_\cc(C, 
        G(D))
    \]  
    which is natural in both $C$ and $D$. In this case, we say that
    $F$ is the \textbf{left-adjoint} and $G$ is the
    \textbf{right-adjoint}. 
\end{definition}
    
    Now, what do we mean by the above equation being natural in both
    $C$ and $D$? Well, for all $h: C' \to
    C$ and $k: D \to D'$, we must have that 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            \hom_\dd(F(C), D)\arrow[r, "\phi_{C,D}"]
            \arrow[d, swap, "k_*"]
            &
            \hom_\cc(C, G(D))\arrow[d, "G(k)_*"]\\
            \hom_\dd(F(C),D') \arrow[r, "\phi_{C,D'}"]
            &
            \hom_\cc(C, G(D'))
        \end{tikzcd}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            \hom_\dd(F(C), D)\arrow[r, "\phi_{C,D}"]
            \arrow[d, swap, "(F(h))^*"]
            &
            \hom_\cc(C, G(D))\arrow[d, "h^*"]\\
            \hom_\dd(F(C'),D) \arrow[r, "\phi_{C,D'}"]
            &
            \hom_\cc(C', G(D))
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    all commute. Here, recall that $k_*(f: F(C) \to D) = k \circ f$,
    and $h^*(g: C \to G(D)) = g \circ h$. The
    commutativity of the diagrams can be written our in terms of
    equations; if $f: F(C) \to D$, then
    \begin{align}
        \phi(k \circ f) = G(k) \circ \phi(f)\\
        \phi(f \circ F(h)) = \phi(f) \circ h.
    \end{align}
    Since $\phi$ is a bijection, we know that 
    \[
        \phi^{-1}: \hom_{\cc}(C, G(D)) \to \hom_\dd(F(C), D)   
    \]
    exists and is also a bijection. And because $\phi$ is natural in
    $C$ and $D$, we know that $\phi^{-1}$ also preserves naturality as
    well. Thus we also have that 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            \hom_\cc(C, G(D))\arrow[r, "\phi^{-1}_{C,D}"]
            \arrow[d, swap, "G(k)_*"]
            &
            \hom_\dd(F(C), D)\arrow[d,  "k_*"]\\
            \hom_\cc(C, G(D')) \arrow[r, "\phi^{-1}_{C,D'}"]
            &
            \hom_\dd(F(C),D')
        \end{tikzcd}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            \hom_\cc(C, G(D))\arrow[d, swap, "h^*"]
            \arrow[r, "\phi^{-1}_{C,D}"]
            &
            \hom_\dd(F(C), D) \arrow[d, "(F(h))^*"]\\
            \hom_\cc(C', G(D)) \arrow[r, "\phi^{-1}_{C,D'}"]
            &
            \hom_\dd(F(C'),D)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    commutes. We can also express this commutativity in terms of
    equations betwee morphisms. If $g: C \to G(D)$, then
    \begin{align}
        k \circ \phi^{-1}(g) = \phi^{-1}(G(k) \circ g)\\
        \phi^{-1}(g) \circ F(h) = \phi^{-1}(g \circ h). 
    \end{align}
    What we're seeing here is the adjunctions give us \textit{a lot of
    shit}, but not bad shit; it gives a lot of good shit. As we'll
    see, there's even more to explore. 


    \section*{Universality from $C$ to $G$.}
    It turns out that the concept of an adjunction goes much deeper
    than what we've just outlined here. Not only do adjunctions appear
    in many places, but they also give rise to universal morphisms. To
    see this, let $D = F(C)$. Then $\phi_{F(C), F(C)}$ forms a
    bijection between the sets 
    \[
        \hom_\cc(F(C), F(C)) \cong \hom_\dd(C, G(F(C))).
    \]
    Now let's chase the identity $1_{F(C)}: F(C) \to F(C)$. 
    The function $\phi$ sends
    $1_{F(C)}$ to a unnique morphism $\phi(1_{F(C)}): C \to G(F(C))$. Call
    this $\eta_C$. 

    For any other $f': F(C) \to F(C)$, we can use equation (3) to
    observe that 
    \begin{align*}
        \phi(f') = \phi(f' \circ 1_{F(C)}) &= G(f') \circ \phi(1_{F(C)})\\
        &= G(f') \circ \eta_C.
    \end{align*}
    Look familiar? Recall Proposition 3.2! The isomorphism 
    \[
        \phi: \hom_\cc(F(C), F(C)) \cong \hom_\dd(C, G(F(C)))
    \]
    which sends each $f': F(C) \to F(C)$ to $G(f') \circ \eta_x$ holds
    if and only if $\eta_C: C \to G(F(C))$ is a universal morphism
    from $C$ to $G$. \textcolor{NavyBlue}{Hence, we see that for
    \textit{every object} $C$ of $\cc$, an adjunction gives rise to a
    universal morphism from $C$ to $G: \dd \to \cc$!}

    Thus there exists some function $\psi$ where 
    \[  
        C \longmapsto \eta_C : C \to G(F(C))
    \]
    which makes $\psi$ a natural transformation, so that 
    \[
        \psi: I_C \to G\circ F
    \] 
    where $I_C$ is
    the trivial functor on $\cc$. Now consider again $h: C' \to C$,
    and observe by equation (4), 
    \begin{align*}
        G(F(h)) \circ \eta_{C'} = G(F(h)) \circ \phi(1_{C'})
        &= \phi(F(h) \circ 1_{C'})\\
        &= \phi(1_{C'} \circ F(h))\\
        &= \phi(1_{C'}) \circ h\\
        &= \eta_{C'} \circ h.
    \end{align*}
    where in the second step used equation (3), and in the fourth step
    we used equation (4). This gives rise to the diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            C' \arrow[r, "\eta_{C'}"]
            \arrow[d, swap, "h"]
            &
            G(F(C')) \arrow[d, "G(F(h))"]\\
            C \arrow[r, swap, "\eta_{C}"]
            &
            G(F(C))
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    which commutes. This then shows that the function which sends $C
    \to \eta_C$ is natural in $C$. That is, not only do we have a
    correspondence between objects of $\cc$ and universal arrows from
    $C$ to $G$, this correspondence respects naturality! 

    \section*{Universality from $F$ to $D$.} 
    We can also perform the same procedure we just did using equations
    (3) and (4) on the equations (5) and (6). Thus consider the
    inverse $\phi^{-1}: \hom_{\cc}(C, G(D)) \to \hom_\dd(F(C), D)$. 
    Suppose we set $C = G(D)$. Then $\phi^{-1}$ gives the bijection 
    \[
        \hom_\dd(F(G(D)), D) \cong \hom_{\cc}(G(D), G(D)).
    \]
    As before, let's consider $1_{G(D)}: G(D) \to G(D)$. Suppose we
    write 
    \[
        \epsilon_D = \phi^{-1}(G(D)): F(G(D)) \to D.   
    \]
    Now consider any $g: G(D) \to G(D)$. Then 
    \begin{align*}
        \phi^{-1}(g) = \phi^{-1}(1_{G(D)} \circ g)
        &= \phi^{-1}(1_{G(D)}) \circ F(g)\\
        &= \epsilon_D \circ F(g).
    \end{align*}
    where we used equation (6). 
    As this is the action of $\phi^{-1}$, and because $\phi^{-1}$
    establishes the above isomorphim between the hom-sets, we can use
    the dual version of Proposition 3.2 (check yourself, it works) to
    conclude that $\epsilon_D:F(G(D)) \to D$ is a universal arrow from $F$
    to $D$, for every object $D$ of $\dd$. Moreover, we can conclude that 
    $\epsilon: F\circ G \to I_\dd$
    is a natural transformation, where $I_\dd$ is the identity functor
    on $\dd$. 

    Finally, observe that 
    \[
        1_{G(D)} = \phi(\phi^{-1}(1_{G(D)})) = \phi(\epsilon_D) = G
        (\epsilon_D) \circ 
        \eta_{G(D)}
    \]
    and that 
    \[
        1_{F(C)} = \phi(\phi^{-1}(1_{F(C)})) = \phi^{-1}(\eta_C) = \epsilon_
        {F(C)} \circ F(\eta_C).
    \]
    Hence we see that the composite natural transformations
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
        G \arrow[r, "\eta_{G}"] & G \circ F \circ G
        \arrow[r,"G(\epsilon)"] & G
        \end{tikzcd}
        \hspace{0.5cm}
        \begin{tikzcd}
        F \arrow[r, "F(\eta)"] & F \circ G \circ G
        \arrow[r, "\epsilon_{F}"]
        & 
        F
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    are both the identity. As we now have a notion of $\eta$ and
    $\epsilon$, we denote $\eta$ as the \textbf{unit} and $\epsilon$
    as the \textbf{counit}. Now all of our analysis proves the following
    theorem. 
    \begin{thm}
        $(F, G, \phi)$ forms an adjunction between $\cc$
        and $\dd$ if and only if
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\bm{(i)}$]There exists a natural transformation
            $\eta: I_\cc \to G \circ F$ such that 
            for each object $C$ of $\cc$, the
            morphism 
            \[
                \eta_C: C \to G(F(C))
            \]
            is universal from $C$ to $G$, and if $f: F(C) \to D$
            \[
                \phi(f) = G(f) \circ \eta_C.  
            \]
            \item[$\bm{(ii)}$] There exists a natural transformation
            $\epsilon: F \circ G \to I_\dd$ such that for each object

            \[
                \epsilon_D: F(G(D)) \to D  
            \]
            is universal from $F$ to $D$, and if $g: C \to G(D)$,
            \[
                \phi^{-1}(g) = \epsilon_{D} \circ F(g).
            \]

            \begin{description}
                \item[$\implies$]Suppose that $(F, G, \phi)$ is an 
                adjunction between $\cc$
                and $\dd$. As $\phi$ establishes the bijection 
                \[
                    \hom_{\dd}(F(C), D) \cong \hom_\cc(C, G(D))
                \]
                for any objects $C, D$ of $\cc, \dd$, repsectively, we can
                set $D = F(C)$ and we have that  
                \[
                    \hom_{\dd}(F(C), F(C)) \cong \hom_\cc(C, G(F(C))).
                \]
                Let $\eta_C = \phi(1_{F(C)})$.
                Then by equation (3), if $f': F(C) \to
                F(c)$ we have that $\phi(f') = G(f') \circ \eta_C$. Then by
                proposition 3.2, we see that $\eta_C: C \to G(F(C))$
                is universal from $C$ to $G$. Hence we get the
                following diagram 
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]

                        & G(D) 
                    \end{tikzcd}
                \end{center}
                Now suppose $h: C \to C'$ is a morphism. Then we see
                that $\eta_{C'} \circ h: C \to G(F(C'))$, and by
                universality (i.e., by the above diagram), this
                implies that there exists a unique morphism $k : F(C) \to
                F(C')$ such that $G(k) \circ \eta_C = \eta_{C'} \circ h$.
                Visually, this is given by the commutative diagram
                below.

                \item[$\impliedby$] Now suppose we have a natural 
                transformation $\eta: I_C
                \to G \circ F$ which assigns each $C$ a universal arrow
                $\eta_C: C \to G(F(C))$ from $C$ to $G$. Then from
                universality, 
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]

                    \end{tikzcd}
                \end{center}
                Every $g: C \to G(D)$ uniquely corresponds witha
                morphism $f: F(C) \to D$. Hence we have a bijection of
                hom-sets
                \[
                    \hom_\dd(F(C), D) \cong \hom_\cc(C, G(D))
                \]
                which is given by some bijection $\phi$. We then have
                that $(F, G, \phi)$ compose an adjunction, as desired. 
            \end{description}

            \item[$\bm{(ii)}$] 
            \begin{description}
                \item[$\implies$] Suppose that $(F, G, \phi)$ is an adjunction between $\cc$
                and $\dd$. As $\phi$ establishes the bijection 
                \[
                    \hom_{\dd}(F(C), D) \cong \hom_\cc(C, G(D))
                \]
                for any objects $C, D$ of $\cc, \dd$, repsectively, we can
                set $C = G(D)$ and we have that  
                \[
                    \hom_{\dd}(F(G(D)), D) \cong \hom_\cc(G(D), G(D)).
                \]
                Now let $\epsilon_D = \phi^{-1}(1_{G(D)})$. Then by
                equation (5), for any $g: C \to G(D)$, we have that
                $\phi^{-1}(g) = \epsilon_D \circ F(g)$.  

                \item[$\impliedby$] 
                Now suppose we have a natural transformation $\eta: F
                \circ G \to I_\dd$ where $\eta_D: F(G(D)) \to D$ is
                universal from $F$ to $D$. Then we have the diagram 
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                        D & \arrow[l, swap, "\epsilon_D"] F(G(D))
                        \\
                        & \arrow[ul, "f"] F(C) \arrow[u, dashed, swap,
                        "F(g)"]

                    \end{tikzcd}
                \end{center} 
                so that for every morphism $F(C) \to D$, there exists
                a unique morphism $g: C \to G(D)$. Hence we have the
                \[
                    \hom_{\dd}(F(G(D)), D) \cong \hom_\cc(G(D), G(D)).
                \]
                We then have that $(F, G, \phi)$ form an adjunction,
                as desired. 
            \end{description}
        \end{description}
    \end{prf}

    Now we offer some sufficient conditions for establishing an
    adjunction. 
    \begin{proposition}
        Let $G: \dd \to C$ be a functor, and that for each $C \in \cc$
        there exists 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[1.] An object $F_0(C) \in \dd$ 
            \item[2.] a universal morphism $\eta_C: C \to G(F_0(C))$
            from $C$ to $G$. 
        \end{itemize}
        Then there exists a functor $F: \cc \to \dd$, left-adjoint to
        $G$. In other words, there exists an adjunction $(F, G, \phi)$
        between $\cc$ and $\dd$.
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{prf}
        To have universality from $C$ to $G$, the diagram 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                \textcolor{red}{C} \arrow[r, "\eta_C"] 
                \arrow[dr, red, swap, "g"]
                & G(F(C)) \arrow[d, dashed, "G(f)"] \\
                & \textcolor{red}{G(D)}
            \end{tikzcd}
            \hspace{1cm}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                \textcolor{blue}{F(C)} \arrow[d, blue, dashed, swap, "f"]\\
                \textcolor{blue}{D}
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        must commute. Hence we have a bijection 
        \[
            \hom_{\dd}(\textcolor{blue}{F(C), D}) \cong \hom_\cc(\textcolor{red}{C, G(D)}).  
        \]
        Now suppose $h: C \to C'$. Then the dashed arrow 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                C \arrow[r, "\eta_C"] \arrow[d, swap, "f"] 
                &
                G(F_0(C)) \arrow[d, dashed, "G(h)"]\\
                C' \arrow[r, swap, "\eta_{C'}"]
                &
                G(F_0(C')) 
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        must exist by universality; we simply utilize the previous
        diagram. In other words, if $h: C \to C'$, then there exists a
        morphism $f: F_0(C) \to F_0(C')$. With that said, we can then
        define a functor where
        $F: \cc \to \dd$ with $F(C) = F_0(C)$ and $F(h) = F_0(C) \to
        F_0(C')$. 

        We then have our triple $(F, G, \phi)$, with $\phi$
        establishing the bijection, so that we have an adjunction
        between $\cc$ and $\dd$ as desired. 
    \end{prf}
    
    Now we consider the parallel of the previous proposition.
    \begin{proposition}
        Let $F: \cc \to \dd$ be a functor. Suppose for each object $d
        \in D$ there exists 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[1.] an object $G_0(D) \in \cc$ 
            \item[2.] a universal morphism $\epsilon_d: F(G_0(D)) \to
            D$ from $F$ to $D$. 
        \end{itemize}
        Then there exists a functor $G: \dd \to \cc$, right-adjoint to
        $F$. In other words, there exists an adjuncton $(F, G, \phi)$
        between $\cc$ and $\dd$. 
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{prf}
        If we have universality from $F$ to $D$, then the diagram 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                \textcolor{blue}{D} & \arrow[l, swap, "\epsilon_D"] F(G(D))
                \\
                & \arrow[ul, blue,"f"] \textcolor{blue}{F(C)} \arrow[u, dashed, swap,
                "F(g)"]
            \end{tikzcd}
            \hspace{1cm}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                \textcolor{red}{G(D)}\\
                \textcolor{red}{C} \arrow[u, red, dashed, "g"]
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center} 
        must commute for every object $C, D$. This then establishes the bijection 
        \[
            \hom_\dd(\textcolor{blue}{F(C), D}) \cong \hom_\cc(\textcolor{red}{C, G(D)}).   
        \]
        Consider any $h: D' \to D$. Then by universality, the dashed
        morphism 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                D 
                & \arrow[l, swap, "\epsilon_d"] F(G_0(D))\\
                D' \arrow[u, "h"] 
                &
                F(G_0(D')) \arrow[l, "\epsilon_{D'}"]
                \arrow[u, dashed, swap, "F(f')"]
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        must exist. In other words, if we have $h: D' \to D$, then
        there must exist a morphism $f' : G_0(D') \to G_0(D)$. We can
        then define a functor $G: \dd \to \cc$ by defining its object
        function to be $G_0$ and defining $G(h) = f'$. Thus we have
        that there exist a right-adjoint to $F$, so that $(F, G,
        \phi)$ forms an adjunction, as desired. 
    \end{prf}

    We now introduce a proposition which offers sufficient conditions
    for an adjunction, although it is not parallel to either of our
    previous propositions. 

    \begin{proposition}
        Let $F: \cc \to \dd$ and $G: \dd \to \cc$ be functors, and
        suppose we have the pair of natural transformations:
        \begin{align*}
            \eta_{C} : I_C \to G \circ F \quad
            \epsilon_{D}: I_D \to F \circ G
        \end{align*}
        such that the following composites are the identity: 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}
            G \arrow[r, "\eta_{G}"] & G \circ F \circ G
            \arrow[r,"G(\epsilon)"] & G
            \end{tikzcd}
            \hspace{0.5cm}
            \begin{tikzcd}
            F \arrow[r, "F(\eta)"] & F \circ G \circ G
            \arrow[r, "\epsilon_{F}"]
            & 
            F
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        Then there exists a bijective $\phi$ such that $(F, G, \phi)$
        form an adjunction between $\cc$ and $\dd$. 
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{example}
    Let $U: \textbf{Ab} \to \textbf{Grp}$ be the
    forgetful functor, and suppose $F: \textbf{Grp} \to \textbf{Ab}$ is 
    the abelianization functor. That is, if $G$ is a group and $\phi:
    G \to G'$ is a group homomorphism then 
    \[
        F(G) = G/[G,G] \qquad F(\phi) : G/[G, G] \to G'/[G',G'].
    \]
    where $[G,G]$ is the commutator subgroup. But how do we know that $\phi$ induces a group homomorphisms on
    the commutator subgroups? Well, define 
    \[
        F(\phi)(g + [G,G]) = \phi(g) + [G',G']. 
    \]
    it's straightforward to show this is well defined (and I'm too
    lazy to do so). Now define the projection $\pi_G: G \to G/[G,G]$ where 
    \[
        \pi(g) = g + [G, G].
    \]
    Then clearly we have that 
    \[
        U(F(\phi)) \circ \pi_G(g) = U(F(\phi)) (g + [G, G]) = \phi(g) + [G, G']
    \]
    while 
    \[
        \pi_{G'} \circ \phi(g) = \phi(g) + [G',G'].
    \]
    Hence we have that $U(F(\phi)) \circ \pi_G = \pi_{G'} \circ \phi$,
    which gives rise to the commutative diagram. 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            G \arrow[r, "\pi_G"] \arrow[d, swap, "\phi"]
            & U(F(G))\arrow[d, "U(F(\phi))"]\\
            G' \arrow[r, swap, "\pi_{G'}"]
            &
            U(F(G'))
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    Since $\pi_G$ is defined for all $G \in \textbf{Grp}$, we can
    conclude that we actually have a natural transformation    
    \[
        \pi : I_{\textbf{Grp}} \to U \circ F.
    \]
    Next we would like to show that $\pi_G$ is universal from $G$ to
    $U$ for every group $G$. Hence consider a morphism $\psi: G \to
    U(H)$, where $H$ is an abelian group. Suppose $g \in [G, G]$, so
    that $g = hkh^{-1}k^{-1}$ for some elements $h, k \in G$. Then we
    have that 
    \[
        \phi(g) = \phi(h)\phi(k)\phi(h)^{-1}\phi(h)^{-1} = e_H
    \]
    since $H$ is abelian. where $e_H$ is the identity of $H$. Hence $[G, G] \subset
    \ker(\psi)$. Hence we can define a morphism $\pi': F(G) \to H$
    where $\pi'(g + [G,G]) = \psi(g)$, so that the diagram 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            G \arrow[r, "\pi_G"] \arrow[dr, swap, "\psi"]
            &
            U(F(G)) \arrow[d, dashed, "U(\pi')"]\\
            & U(H)

    \end{center} 
    commutes. Since $\pi'$ exists and is unique, and because $\psi$
    was arbitrary, this shows that $\pi_G$ is universal from $G$ to
    $U$. 
    
    \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{At this point, we have everything we
    need. We have two functors}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{\textbf{Grp}} \arrow[r, MidnightBlue, shift left=0.6ex,"F"] & \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{\textbf{Ab}}

    \end{tikzcd}
    \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{and we know there exists a natural
    transformation $\pi: 
    I_{\textbf{Grp}} \to U \circ F$ such that $\pi_G: G \to U(F(G))$
    is universal from $G$ to $U$ for all $G \in \textbf{Grp}$.
    Therefore, we have an adjunction, and we can establish the
    following bijection:}
    \[
        \hom_{\textbf{Ab}}(H/[H,H], G) \cong \hom_{\textbf{Grp}}(H, U(G)).
    \]
    where $H$ is a group and $G$ is an abelian group. How do we
    interpret this result? This states that every group homomorphism $\psi: H
    \to U(G)$ corresponds uniquely to a group homomorphism $\phi:
    H/[H,H] \to  G$ between abelian groups, and vice versa. This is a
    standard result in group theory, but our adjunction allows us to
    prove the unique corresponds goes \textit{both} ways, and hence we
    can prove there's a bijection between these homsets. Moreover, our
    adjunction assures us that this bijection is natural in both
    objects $G, H$! 
    \end{example}


    \begin{example}
        Let $U: \textbf{R-Mod} \to \textbf{Ab}$ be the forgetful functor,
    which forgets the $R$-module structure on the underlying abelian
    group $M$. Consider the functor $F: \textbf{Ab} \to
    \textbf{R-Mod}$, where $F(A) = R \otimes A$. We'll show that this
    is left-adjoint to $U$ as follows. 

    To show this, we'll propose a morphism which we will show to be
    universal. If $A$ is an abelian group, then we let 
    $\eta_A : A \to U(F(A))$ where $\eta_A(a) = 1 \otimes a$. 

    Thus let $M$ be an $R$-module, and suppose there exists a morphism
    $f: A \to U(M)$. Then we can define a morphism $\phi: F(A) \to M$
    where 
    \[
        \phi(r \otimes a) = r\cdot f(a).
    \]
    Our construction ensures that this is a well-defined $R$-module
    homomorphism. Hence we clearly have the equality $U(\phi) \circ \eta_A =
    f$. Visually, this becomes 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            A \arrow[r, "\eta_A"] \arrow[dr, swap, "f"]
            &
            U(F(A)) \arrow[d, dashed, "U(\phi)"]\\
            & U(M)
        \end{tikzcd}
        \hspace{1cm}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            F(A) \arrow[d, dashed, "\phi"]\\
            M
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center} 
    Since the construction of $\phi$ depends directly on the existence
    of $f$, we see that it is unique. Hence we see that $\eta_A: A \to
    U(F(A))$ is universal from $A$ to $U$. Then by Theorem 4.1, we see
    that we have an adjunction, so that $F$ is truly left adjoint to
    the forgetful functor $U$. 
    
    \end{example}

    \begin{proposition}
        Let $F, F' : \cc \to \dd$ be two left adjoints of the functor
        $G : \dd \to \cc$. Then $F, F'$ are naturally isomorphic. 
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{prf}
        Let $(F, G, \phi)$ and $(F', G, \phi')$ be two adjunctions
        between  $\cc$ and $\dd$. Then these adjoints give rise to the
        universal morphisms
        \[
            \eta_C : C \to G(F(C)) \quad \eta'_{C}: C \to G(F'(C))
        \]
        for every $C \in \cc$. Since these are both universal
        morphisms from $C$ to $G$, we know that they are isomorphic.
        Hence there exists a unique isomorphism $\theta_C :  F(C) \to
        F'(C)$ by universality such that $G(\theta_C) \circ \eta_C =
        \eta_C'$ (think of a universal diagram). 

        Now let $h: C \to C'$ be a morphism in $\cc$. Then 
        $F'(h) \circ \theta_C = \theta_{C'} \circ F(h)$ so that the diagram 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                F(C) \arrow[r, "\theta_C"] \arrow[d, swap, "F(h)"]
                & F'(C) \arrow[d, "F'(h)"]\\
                F(C') \arrow[r, swap, "\theta_{C'}"]
                &
                F'(C')
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        commutes. Hence we see that $\theta: F \to F'$ is a natural
        isomorphic transformation between $F$ and $F'$, so that these
        two functors are naturally isomorphic.
    \end{prf}
    The other direction holds as well. That is, two right adjoints to
    one left adjoint are natrually isomorphic as well, and the proof
    is the same. We now have our last proposition for this section. 

    \begin{proposition}
        Let $G: \dd \to \cc$ be a functor. Then $G$ has a left-adjoint
        $F: \cc \to \dd$ if and only if for each $C \in \cc$, the
        functor $\hom_{\cc}(C, G(-))$ is representable as a functor of
        $D \in \dd$. Furthermore, if $\phi: \hom_{\dd}(F_0(C), D)
        \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, G(D))$ is a representation of this
        functor, then $F_0$ is the object function of $F$. 
    \end{proposition}

    Finally, we end this section by realizing that we can actually
    form composition of adjoints. 
    \begin{thm}
        Let $\cc, \dd$ and $\ee$ be categories. Suppose we have
        adjunctions 
        \[
            (F, G, \eta, \epsilon): \cc \to \dd 
            \qquad 
            (F', G', \eta', \epsilon;): \dd \to \ee.
        \]
        Then there exists a composite adjunction given by 
        \[
            (F'\circ F, G \circ G', \overline{\eta}, \overline{\epsilon}): 
            \cc \to \ee.
        \]
        where 
        \begin{align*}
            \overline{\eta}_C = G(\eta'_{F(C)}) \circ \eta_C: C \to
            (G\circ G) \circ (F'\circ F(C))\\
            \overline{\epsilon}_E = \epsilon'_E \circ F'(\epsilon_{G'(E)}) 
            : (F' \circ F) \circ (G \circ G'(E)) \to E
        \end{align*}
        \vspace{-0.7cm}
    \end{thm}

    \begin{prf}
        First, observe that the two given adjunctions give rise to 
        \[
            \hom_{\dd}(F(C), D) \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, G(D)) 
            \qquad 
            \hom_{\ee}(F'(D), E) \cong \hom_{\dd}(D, G'(E)).
        \]
        which are relations that are natural in objects $C, D$ and
        $E$. Observe that in the second relation, we can set $D =
        F(C)$. This then translates to 
        \[
            \hom_{\ee}(F'(F(C)), E) \cong \hom_{\dd}(F(C), G'(E)).
        \]
        Using the first relation, we know that 
        $\hom_{\dd}(F(C), G(E)) \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, G(G'(E)))$.
        Putting this together, we then have the bijection of homsets 
        \[
            \hom_{\ee}(F'\circ F(C)), E) \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, G \circ G'(E))
        \]
        which is natural in $C$ and $E$. Now, describing the
        unit and counit is a bit ugly, and not exactly necessary, since in
        the end we know what these adjunctions look like. The
        punchline here is that we can write our new unit and counit in
        terms of the original ones. 

        Observe that for any object $C$ of $\cc$, we have the universal
        morphism 
        \[
             \eta_C: C \to G(F(C)).
        \]
        Since $F(C) \in \dd$, we can use $\eta'$ that
        \[
            \eta'_{F(C)}: F(C) \to G'(F'(F(C))).            
        \]
        Finally, note that $G(\eta'_{F(C)}): G(F(C)) \to G(G'(F'(F(C))))$.
        However, we can precompose this with $\eta_C$ to have that 
        \[
            G(\eta'_{F(C)}) \circ \eta_C: C \to G(G'(F'(F(C)))).
        \]
        On the other hand, for any object $E$ of $\ee$ that 
        \[
            \epsilon'_E : F'(G'(E)) \to E.
        \]
        We also have $\epsilon_D : F(G(D)) \to D$ for any object $D
        \in \dd$. Hence, 
        we can set $D = G'(E)$ for some object $E$ of $\ee$
        to get
        \[
            \epsilon_{G'(E)} : F(G(G'(E))) \to G'(E).
        \]
        We can then get that $F'(\epsilon_{G'(E)}) : F'(F(G(G'(E))))
        \to F'(G'(E))$. Composing this with the original
        $\epsilon'_D$, we get that 
        \[
            \epsilon'_E \circ F'(\epsilon_{G'(E)}): F'(F(G(G'(E)))) \to E
        \] 
        as desired. Now showing that these remain universal is not
        hard; just annoying. 
    \end{prf}


    \begin{exercise}[Exercise 4.2.2] 
        \textcolor{purple}{Show that the functor $U: \textbf{R-Mod}

    \end{exercise}

    \begin{solution}
        In a previous example, we already showed that the functor

            between abelian groups. Then this necessarily induces a

                F(f) = f^*: \hom_{\zz}(R, A) \to \hom_{\zz}(R, G)
            \]
            where $f^*(\phi: R \to A) = f \circ \phi : R \to G$. 
            
            
        \end{description}
    \end{solution}

    
    \newpage
    \section{Reflective Subcategories.} 

    \begin{definition}
        Let $\aa$ be a subcategory of $\cc$. We say $\aa$ is
        \textbf{reflective} in $\cc$ whenever the inclusion functor
        $I: \aa \to \cc$ has a left adjoint $F: \cc \to \aa$. We then
        say the functor $F$ is the \textbf{reflector}, and the
        adjunction $(F, I, \phi)$ is a \textbf{reflection} of $B$. 
    \end{definition}
    In the case of a reflection, we obtain the bijection of hom-sets 
    \[
        \hom_{\aa}(F(C),A) \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, I(A)) \implies \hom_{\aa}(F(C),A) \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, A) 
    \]
    which is natural in both $C$ and $A$. 

    \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{At this point, we've seen about 7
    different formulations which lead to the notion of an adjunction. Therefore, 
    the above definition is not a definitive one of what it means to
    have a reflector. A reflector simply requires the existence of an
    adjunction, but an adjunction can be determined by various different conditions.
    }

    For example, we can also describe a reflection as follows: $\aa
    \subset \cc$ is \textbf{reflective} if and only if for each $C \in \cc$,
    there exists a universal morphism $\eta_C \to I(F(C))$ from $C$ to
    $I$, where we assume we already have the functors 
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
        \aa \arrow[r, shift left=0.6ex,"I"] & \cc.
        \arrow[l,shift right =-0.6ex, "F"]
    \end{tikzcd}
    As an example, recall that we showed that $F: \textbf{Grp} \to
    \textbf{Ab}$ is the left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U:
    \textbf{Ab} \to \textbf{Grp}$. The argument is unchanged if we
    instead consider the inclusion functor $I: \textbf{Ab} \to
    \textbf{Grp}$. That is, $F$ is a left adjoint to this functor. We
    then see that $\textbf{Ab}$ is reflective in $\textbf{Grp}.$

    \begin{example}
        Let $\textbf{Top}$ be the category of topological spaces with
        morphisms continuous functions. Let $\textbf{CHaus}$, the
        category of compact Hausdorff spaces, which is a subcategory
        of $\textbf{Top}$. 

        If we let $X$ be a topological space, then we denote
        $\beta(X)$ to be the Stone-Cech compactification. Let $I :
        \textbf{CHaus} \to \textbf{Top}$ be the inclusion functor. 
        Then the definition of the Stone-Cech compactification of a space $X$ is the
        universal property: 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                X \arrow[dr, swap, "f'"] \arrow[r, "u"] & I(\beta(X)) \arrow[d, dashed, "\beta(f)"]\\
                & I(C)
            \end{tikzcd}
            \hspace{1cm}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                \beta(X) \arrow[d, dashed, "f"]\\
                C
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        That is, the Stone-Cech compactification is a topological
        space $\beta(X)$ with a morphism $u: X \to \beta(X)$ which is
        universal across all morphisms $f: X \to C$ where $C$ is
        compact, Hausdorff. 

        Thus we see that a Stone-Cech compactification gives
        rise to an object $\beta(X) \in \textbf{CHaus}$ and a
        universal morphism $X \to I(\beta(X))$ from $X$ to $I$. Now by
        Proposition 4.1, this makes $\beta : \textbf{Top} \to
        \textbf{CHaus}$ a functor, which is left adjoint to the
        inclusion functor $I: \textbf{CHaus} \to \textbf{Top}$. 

        This then makes $\beta: \textbf{Top} \to \textbf{CHaus}$ a
        reflector, so that the adjunction is a relflection between
        $\textbf{Top}$ and $\textbf{CHaus}$. Consequently we have the
        bijection 
        \[
            \hom_{\textbf{Top}}(X, I(C)) \cong \hom_{\textbf{CHaus}}(\beta(X), C)
            \implies 
            \hom_{\textbf{Top}}(X, C) \cong \hom_{\textbf{CHaus}}(\beta(X), C).
        \]
        since $I(C)$ is technically no different than from $C$. This
        bijection is natural in both $X$ and $C$. 
    \end{example}

    \begin{exercise}[Exercise 2.]
        \textcolor{purple}{Show that the torsion-free abelian groups form a full
        reflective subcategory of $\textbf{Ab}$.}
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{solution}
        Let $\textbf{Ab}_{\textbf{TF}}$ represent the category of
        abelian groups with torsion free elements (for a lack of
        better notation). Then we have a natural inclusion functor 
        $I: \textbf{Ab}_{\textbf{TF}} \to \textbf{Ab}$.
        Now consider the functor $F : \textbf{Ab} \to
        \textbf{Ab}_{\textbf{TF}}$, which we define as follows:
        \begin{description}
            \item[Objects.] Let $G$ be an abelian group. Then 
            $F(G) = G_{TF}$ where 
            \[
                G_{TF} = \{g \in G \mid g^n \ne e \text{ for } n = 1, 2, 3, \dots\}.
            \] 
            That is, it sends $G$ to its underlying abelian group of
            torsion-free elements. It's not hard to show this is an
            abelian group.
            
            \item[Morphisms.] Suppose $\phi: G \to H$ is a morphism
            between abelian groups. Then we set $F(\phi) = \phi_{TF}$
            where 
            \[
                \phi_{TF}: G_{TF} \to H_{TF} \qquad \phi_{TF}(g) = \phi(g).
            \]
            Note that this definition will cause no issues, since
            $\text{ord}(g) = \text{ord}(\phi(g))$. Thus we simply
            obtain $\phi_{TF}$ by restricting $\phi$ to $G_{TF}$.
        \end{description} 
        To show that $F$ is left adjoint to $I$, we need to
        demonstrate that there exists a universal morphism $\eta_{G} :
        G \to I(F(G))$ for every $G \in \textbf{Ab}$. Hence we propose
        $\eta_{G}$ takes on the form 
        \[
            \eta_{G}(g) = 
            \begin{cases}
                g & \text{ if } \text{ord}(g) = \infty\\
                e & \text{ otherwise. }
            \end{cases}
        \]
        To show this is universal from $G$ to $I$, suppose we have a
        morphism $\phi: G \to I(H)$, where $H \in
        \textbf{Ab}_{\textbf{TF}}$. Then there exists a morphism
        $\psi: F(G) \to H$ such that $I(\phi) \circ \eta_{G} = \phi$.
        Visually, that is, 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                G \arrow[dr, swap, "\phi"]\arrow[r, "\eta_{G}"] & I(F(G)) \arrow[d, dashed,
                "I(\psi)"]\\
                & I(H)
            \end{tikzcd}
            \hspace{1cm}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                F(G) \arrow[d, dashed, "\psi"]\\
                H
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        Sure such a morphism exists, but why the equality? 
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\bm{g \in \ker(\eta_G)}$.] If $g \in \ker(\eta_G)$,
            then $g$ has finite order. Hence we see that $\phi(g) =
            e$; this is because $\text{ord}(\phi(g)) =
            \text{ord}(g) < \infty$, but the only element in $I(H)$
            with finite order is $e$. We then have that $g \in
            \ker(\phi)$. Therefore, 
            \[
                I(\psi)\circ \eta_G(g) = I(\psi)(e) = e = \phi(g).
            \]
            Hence $I(\psi) \circ \eta_G = \phi$ if $g \in
            \ker(\eta_{G})$. 

            \item[$\bm{g \not\in \ker(\eta_G)}$.]
            if $g \not\in \ker(\eta_G)$, then we know that
            $\text{ord}(g) = \infty$. Therefore, we see that 
            \[
                I(\psi) \circ \eta_G(g) = I(\phi)(g) = \phi(g).
            \] 
            Hence $I(\psi) \circ \eta_G = \phi$ for $g \not\in
            \ker(\eta_G)$. 
        \end{description}
        By our previous work, we then have that $I(\psi) \circ \eta_G
        = \phi$, as desired. Now $\psi$ is of course unique based on
        its construction, since its definition depends directly on
        $\phi$. We then have that $\eta_G: G \to I(F(G))$ is universal
        from $G$ to $I$ for each $G \in \textbf{Ab}$! 

        We then have by Theorem 4.1 that $F, I$ form an adjunction, so
        that $F$ is the left adjoint of $I$. Hence by definition, we
        see that $\textbf{AB}_{\textbf{TF}}$ forms a full reflective
        subcategory of $\textbf{Ab}$.

    \section{Equivalence of Categories}
    In an ideal world, if we have a category of which we are
    interested in, our goal would be to find an isomorphism between it
    and a category of which we understand very well. We then know that
    certain mathematical structures are invariant between
    transitioning between the two, so that we could better understand
    our desired category. 

    However, this is generally too much to ask for. Many categories
    which are constructed are constructed in such a way that they're
    not isomorphic to anything we're familiar with; if they were, then
    they probably wouldn't be interesting.
    Hence we have a more useful notion of equivalence between
    categories. 

    \begin{definition}
        Let $F : \cc \to \dd$ be a functor. We say that $\cc$ is
        \textbf{equivalent} to $\dd$ if there exists a functor $G:\dd \to \cc$
        and natural isomorphisms $\eta: I_\cc \to G \circ F $ and
        $\epsilon: F \circ G \to I_\dd$.

        In this case, we say both $F$ and $G$ are an \textbf{equivalence of categories}.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets, and regard them as discrete categories. Then a
        functor $F: X \to Y$ is just a function between sets. In this case, to say 
        that $X$ and $Y$ are equivalent is if there exists a functor (function!) 
        $G: Y \to X$ such that we have natural isomorphisms 
        $\eta_x: x \to G(F(x))$ and $\epsilon_x: F(G(x)) \to x$. However, 
        each category has nontrivial morphisms; hence we see that each of 
        these must be identity morphisms so that 
        \[
            G(F(x)) = x \qquad F(G(x)) = x.
        \]
        What this then means is that an equivalence of categories 
        for sets is just a pair of invertible functions. That is, 
        it gives rise to an isomorphism. 
    \end{example}

    Since $\eta, \epsilon$ are already natural transformations, this
    simply makes them natural isomorphisms. It turns out that the
    notion of equivalence is more useful than of an isomorphism. An
    isomorphism is just too much to ask, but equivalence does give us
    nice invariants too. 

    \begin{definition}
        A \textbf{adjoint equivalence} between categories $C$ and $D$
        is an adjunction $(F, G, \eta, \epsilon)$ where the unit and
        counit $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ are natural isomorphisms.
    \end{definition}

    It turns our an adjoint equivalence is the same thing as an
    equivalence between categories. But before we move on, we prove a
    lemma and a proposition.
    \begin{lemma}
        Let $\cc$ be a category, and $f: A \to B$ a morphism. Then 
        $f$ induces a natural transformation 
        \[
            f^*: \hom_{\cc}(C, -) \to \hom_{\cc}(C', -)
        \]
        Then $f^{*}$ is a monomorphism if and only if $f$ is an epimorphism, 
        and $f^{*}$ is an epimorphism if and only if $f$ is a split monomorphism 
        (that is, if and only if $f$ has a left-inverse.)
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{prf}
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\bm{\implies}$] Observe that $\hom_{\cc}(C, -) \to
            \cc \to \textbf{Set}$ is a functor. Then $f^*:
            \hom_{\cc}(C, -) \to \hom_{\cc}(C', -)$ is a natural transformation where
            $f: C' \to C$. Now suppose $\eta, \eta': F
            \to \hom_{\cc}(C, -)$, where $F: \cc \to \textbf{Set}$ is a functor, are
            natural transformations. Then if $f^*$ is monic, 
            \[  
                f^* \circ \eta = f^* \circ \eta' \implies \eta = \eta'.
            \]
            Now let $h: A \to A'$ be a morphism in $\cc$. Then we have the
            commutative diagram 
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    A \arrow[d, "h"]\\
                    A'
                \end{tikzcd}
                \hspace{1cm}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    F(A) \arrow[r, "{\eta_A, \eta'_A}"] \arrow[d, swap, "F(h)"] 
                    &
                    \hom_{\cc}(C, A) \arrow[d, "h_*"] \arrow[r, "f^*"]
                    &
                    \hom_{\cc}(C', A) \arrow[d, "h_*"]
                    \\
                    F(A') \arrow[r,swap, "{\eta_{A'}, \eta'_{A'}}"] 
                    &
                    \hom_{\cc}(C, A') \arrow[r,swap, "f^*"]
                    &
                    \hom_{\cc}(C', A')
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            where we denote $\eta_A, \eta'_{A}$ on the arrow to
            signify the fact that both $\eta_A, \eta_A'$ are morphisms
            from $F(A)$ to $\hom_{\cc}(C, A)$. Now 
            let $x \in F(A)$. Then
            \[
                f^* \circ \eta_A(x) = f^* \circ \eta'_A(x) \iff \eta_A(x) \circ f = \eta'_A(x) \circ f.
            \]
            But if $f$ is monic, then $f^* \circ \eta_A(x) = f^*
            \circ'_A(x)$ implies that $\eta_A = \eta'_A$. Hence
            we see that $\eta_A(x) \circ f = \eta'_A(x) \circ f
            \implies \eta_A(x) = \eta'_A(x).$

            \item[$\bm{\impliedby}$] Now suppose $f$ is epic. Then
            using the same notation as earlier, note that 
            \[
                f^* \circ \eta_A(x) = f^* \circ \eta'_A(x) \iff \eta_A(x) \circ f = \eta'_A(x) \circ f \implies \eta_{A} = \eta_{A}.
            \]
            Hence we see that $f^*$ is a monomorphism. 
        \end{description}
    \end{prf}
    Taking the dual of what we proved, we prove the second part of the
    lemma. Now we'll use this lemma in the theorem below, one which will be very useful.

    \begin{proposition}
        Let $(F, G, \eta, \epsilon)$ be an adjunction between
        categories $\cc$ and $\dd$. Then 
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\bm{(i)}$] $G$ is faithful if and only if for each
            $D \in \dd$, $\epsilon_{D}$ is epic 
            \item[$\bm{(ii)}$] $G$ is full if and only if every
            $\epsilon_{D}$ is split monic. 
        \end{description}
        Therefore, $G$ is full and faithful if and only if
        $\epsilon_D$ is an isomorphism between $F(G(D))$ and $D$. 
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{prf}
        If $G: \dd \to \cc$ is a functor, then we see that $G$ itself
                becomes a natural transformation between the two
                functors: 
                \[
                    G_{D,-}: \hom_{\dd}(D, -) \to \hom_{\dd}(G(D), G(-)).    
                \]
                Recall that we have an adjunction given by $F, G$.
                Then there exists a bijection $\phi$ where 
                \[
                    \phi_{C, D'}: \hom_{\cc}(F(C), D') \to \hom_{\dd}(C, G(D)).
                \]
                Thus $\phi^{-1}: \hom_{\dd}(C, G(D)) \to
                \hom_{\dd}(F(C), D')$. Moreover, if $D$ is an
                arbitrary object, this becomes a natural
                transformation between the two functors: 
                \[
                    \phi^{-1}_{C, -}: \hom_{\dd}(C, G(-)) \to \hom_{\cc}(F(C), -).
                \]
                Let $C = G(D)$. Then we have the following sequence of
                natural transformations:
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                        \hom_{\dd}(D,-) \arrow[r, "G_{D, -}"]
                        &
                        \hom_{\cc}(G(D), G(-)) \arrow[r, "\phi^{-1}_{G(D), G(-)}"]
                        &
                        \hom_{\dd}(F(G(D)), -)
                    \end{tikzcd}
                \end{center}
                Composing the natural transformations, we finally
                obtain a natural transformation 
                $\phi^{-1}_{G(D), G(-)} \circ G_{D, -} : \hom_{\dd}(D,
                -) \to \hom_{\dd}(F(G(D)), -)$. How is this natural
                transformation given? We can assign $-$ as $D$ itself,
                and see what happens when we consider the identity
                morphism $1_D: D \to D$. In this case
                \[
                    \phi^{-1}_{G(D), G(D)} \circ G_{D, D}(1_D) 
                    = 
                    \phi^{-1}_{G(D), G(D)}(1_{G(D)})
                    = 
                    \epsilon_{D}
                \]
                by definition of the counit $\epsilon_D$. Now we
                understand how this poorly-notated natural
                transformation works! In general, for and $f: D \to
                D'$, we see that 
                \begin{align}
                    \phi^{-1}_{G(D), G(D')} \circ G_{D, D'}(f) = f \circ \epsilon_{D}.
                \end{align}
                Thus, we see that this natural transformation is in
                disguise; it's actually just $\epsilon_D^*:
                \hom_{\dd}(D, -) \to \hom_{\dd}(F(G(D), -)$!
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\bm{(i)}$]
            \begin{description}
                \item[$\bm{\iff}$]
                If $G$ is faithful, then the natural
                transformation in equation (7) is one to one. This makes
                $\epsilon_D^*$ a monomorphism. By the previous lemma,
                this holds if and only if $\epsilon_D$ is epic for every $D$
                in $\dd$.
             
            \end{description} 
            \item[$\bm{(ii)}$]
            \begin{description}
                \item[$\bm{\iff}$]
                On the other hand, if $G$ is full, then this natural
                transformation in equation (7) surjective. This makes
                $\epsilon_{D}^*$ an epimorphism, and by the previous
                lemma, that holds if and only if $\epsilon_D$ is a split monomorphism. 
            \end{description}   
        \end{description}
    \end{prf}



    \begin{thm}\label{equivalence_theorem}
        Let $F: \cc \to \dd$ be a functor. Then the following are
        equivalent. 
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\bm{(i)}$] $G$ is an equivalence of categories 
            \item[$\bm{(ii)}$] $G$ is part of an adjunction $(F, G,
            \eta, \epsilon)$ where $\eta, \epsilon$ are natural
            isomorphisms 
            \item[$\bm{(iii)}$] $F$ is full and faithful, and each
            object $C$ is isomorphic to $G(D)$ for 
            some object $D$. 
        \end{description} 
    \end{thm}
    Note that this theorem is symmetric; one could interchange $G$
    with $F$, and then obtain the same exact results. \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{Thus, one 
    way of stating this theorem is that $\cc$ and $\dd$ are equivalent
    as categories if and only if there exits full and faithful
    functors $F: \cc \to \dd$ and $G: \dd \to \cc$; or if and only if
    $F, G$ form an adjoint equivalence.}

    \begin{prf}
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\bm{(i) \implies (iii)}$] 
            Suppose we have an equivalence of categories given by $F:
            \cc \to \dd$ and $G: \dd \to \cc$, with natural
            isomorphisms 
            \[
                \phi: F \circ G \cong I_\dd \qquad \psi: G \circ F \cong I_\cc.
            \]
            Let $f: C \to C'$ be a morphism in $\cc$. Then observe
            that the following diagram
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    C \arrow[d, "f"]\\
                    C'
                \end{tikzcd}
                \hspace{1cm}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    G(F(C)) \arrow[r, "\psi_C"] \arrow[d, swap, "G(F(C))"]
                    &
                    C \arrow[d, "f"]\\
                    G(F(C')) \arrow[r, swap, "\psi_C'"] 
                    &
                    C'
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            is commutative. In an equations, we have that $f = \psi_C'
            \circ G(F(f)) \circ \psi_{C'}^{-1}$. Thus suppose that
            $f_1, f_2: C \to C'$ are two morphisms such that $F(f_1)
            =F(f_2)$. Then we get a pair of commutative diagrams,
            similar to the ones above, which translate into the
            equations 
            \[
                f_1 = \psi_{C}'\circ G(F(f_1)) \circ \psi_{C'}^{-1}  
                \qquad 
                f_2 = \psi_{C'}\circ G(F(f_2)) \circ \psi_{C'}^{-1}.
            \]
            Then if $F(f_1) = F(f_2)$, the above equations guarantee
            that $f_1 = f_2$. Hence we see that $F$ is a faithful
            functor. Since the statement is symmetric in both $F$ and
            $G$, we have also that $G$ is faithful.
            
            To show that $F$ is full, suppose there exists a morphism
            $h: F(C) \to F(C')$ for a pair of objects $C, C'$. Let $f
            = \psi_{C'} \circ G(h) \circ \psi_C$. Then we have the
            commutative squares
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    G(F(C)) \arrow[r, "\psi_C"] \arrow[d, swap, "G(h)"]
                    &
                    C \arrow[d, "f"]\\
                    G(F(C')) \arrow[r, swap, "\psi_C'"] 
                    &
                    C'.
                \end{tikzcd}
                \hspace{1cm}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    G(F(C)) \arrow[r, "\psi_C"] \arrow[d, swap, "G(F(f))"]
                    &
                    C \arrow[d, "f"]\\
                    G(F(C')) \arrow[r, swap, "\psi_C'"] 
                    &
                    C'.
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            and hence we have that $G(h) = G(F(f))$. But since $G$ is faithful, 
            this implies that $h = F(f)$. Hence we have that there
            exists a $f': C \to C'$ such that $h = F(f)$, so that $F$
            is full. Again, by symmetry, we have that $G$ is full,
            as desired. 

            Now since $\phi: G \circ F \cong I_\cc$, we see that every
            object $C$ is assigned an isomorphism $\phi_C: G(F(C)) \to
            C$. Hence every object $C$ is isomorphic to some $G(D)$
            where $D = F(C)$. 
            
            Similarly, since $\psi: F \circ G \cong I_\dd$, we know
            that each object $D$ is assigned an isomorphism $\psi_D:
            F(G(D)) \to D$. Hence every object $D$ is isomorphic to
            some object $F(C)$ for $C = G(D)$. 

            \item[$\bm{(iii) \implies (ii)}$]
            Suppose $(iii)$ holds. For any  arbitrary object $C \in
            \cc$, there exists an isomorphism $\eta_C: C \to G(D)$ for some
            object $D \in \dd$. Denote such an object as $F_0(C)$. 
            Now consider any other morphism $g: C
            \to G(D')$. Then we have that 
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    C \arrow[r, "\eta_C"] \arrow[dr, swap, "g"] & G(F_0(C)) \arrow[d, dashed, "g \circ f^{-1}"]\\
                    & G(D') 
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            is commutative. Now since $g \circ \eta_C^{-1}: G(F_0(C)) \to
            G(D')$, and because $G$ is full, we know that there exists
            a $h: F_0(C) \to D'$ such that $g \circ \eta_C^{-1} = G(h)$. To show
            that this is unique, suppose there existed another $k:
            G(F_0(C)) \to G(D')$ such that $g = k \circ \eta_C$. Then by the
            same argument, there exists a $h': F_0(C) \to D'$ such that
            $G(h') = k$. Furthermore, we'll have that 
            \[
                k = G(h') = g \circ \eta_C^{-1} \qquad G(h) = g \circ \eta_C^{-1}
            \]
            so that $G(h') = G(h)$. However, since $G$ is faithful, we
            have that $h' = h$. Hence, $h$ is unique! 

            Since $h$ is unique, this implies that $\eta_C : C \to G(F_0(C))$ is
            universal from $C$ to $G$. Since such a universal
            isomorphism exists for each object of $C$, we have by
            Proposition 4.1 that there exists a functor $F: \cc \to
            \dd$ with object function $F_0(C)$ which is left adjoint
            to $G$. Hence we have an adjunction $(F, G, \eta',
            \epsilon)$. However, since universal morphisms are unique,
            we see that $\eta' = \eta$, so that $\eta$, our unit, is a
            natural isomorphism. 
            
            Finally, observe that for any object $D$, we have that 
            \[
                G(\epsilon_D) \circ \eta_{G(D)} = 1_{G(D)}
            \]
            for our adjunction. Since $\eta_{G(D)}$ is an isomorphism,
            we have that $G(\epsilon_D) = \eta_{G(D)}^{-1}$. Sine $G$
            is full and faithful, we see that $\epsilon_D$ must be an isomorphism as well. 
            
            Thus, in total, we have an adjoint equivalence $(F, G, \eta,
            \epsilon)$, as desired. 
            
            \item[$\bm{(ii) \implies (i)}$] This direction is clear,
            since an adjoint equivalence automatically establishes an
            equivalence of categories. 
        \end{description}
        With $(i) \implies (iii) \implies (ii) \implies (i)$, we see
        that all of the conditions are equivalent. 
    \end{prf}

    \begin{example}
        Let $R$ and $S$ be rings and consider the categories 
        $R$\textbf{-Mod} and $S$\textbf{-Mod}. Then there are two different 
        ``product'' categories we can form: The categories $(R \times S)$\textbf{-Mod} 
        and $R\textbf{-Mod}\times S\textbf{-Mod}$
    \end{example}

    Next, we introduce some properties of equivalences. 
    \begin{proposition}
        Let $F: \cc \to \dd$ be an equivalence of categories with the
        corresponding inverse functor $G: \dd \to \cc$. Let $f: C \to
        C'$ be a morphism in $\cc$. Then  
        \begin{description}
            \item[$(i)$] $f$ is a monomorphism (epimorphism)
            if and only if 
            $F(f)$ is a monomorphism (epimorphism)
            \item[$(ii)$] $C$ is initial (terminal) if and only if $F(C)$ is initial (terminal).
        \end{description}
    \end{proposition}

    Consequently, we have that $f$ is an isomorphism (a monomorphism and epimorphism) if and only
    if $F(F)$ is an isomorphism. 
    \textcolor{Red!90}{Note this is not generally true!}
    Additionally, we also have that
    $C$ is a zero object (terminal and initial) if and only if
    $F(C)$ is a zero object. Finally, observe that this
    proposition is symmetric, so that the same conclusions hold
    for morphisms and objects in $\dd$ governed by $G: \dd \to
    \cc$. 

    \begin{prf}
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\bm{(i)}$] 
            \begin{description}
                \item[$\bm{\implies}$] Suppose $f: C \to C'$ is a
                monomorphism. Consider two morphisms $g,h: D \to F(C)$
                such that $F(f) \circ g = F(f) \circ h$. By the
                previous theorem, we know however that there exists an
                object $A$ of $\cc$ such that $D \cong F(A)$. Hence
                there exists an isomorphism $\theta: F(A) \to D$. We
                then have the diagram:
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tikzcd}
                        F(A) \arrow[r, "\theta"]
                        &
                        D \arrow[r, swap, shift right =0.6ex, "g"]
                        \arrow[r,shift right =-0.6ex, "h"] 
                        &
                        F(C) \arrow[r, "F(f)"]
                        &
                        F(C')
                    \end{tikzcd}
                \end{center}
                Note that $h \circ \theta, g \circ \theta: F(A) \to
                F(C)$. Since $F$ is full, we know that there exists 
                morphism $k, k': A \to C$ such that $g \circ \theta =
                F(k)$ and $h \circ \theta = F(k')$. 
                Now observe that 
                \begin{align*}
                    &F(f \circ k) = F(f) \circ F(k) = F(f) \circ h \circ \theta\\
                    &F(f \circ k')= F(f) \circ F(k') = F(f) \circ g \circ \theta.
                \end{align*}
                However, since $F(f) \circ h = F(f) \circ g$, we see
                that $F(f \circ k) = F(f \circ k')$. However, since
                $F$ is faithful, we have that $f \circ k = f \circ
                k'$. But since $f$ is a monomorphism, we have that $k
                = k'$. Hence $F(k) = F(k') \implies g \circ \theta = k
                \circ \theta$, and since $\theta$ is an isomorphism,
                we have that $h = g$. Therefore, $F(f)$ is also monic.

                \item[$\bm{\impliedby}$] 
                Suppose $f: C \to C'$ and $F(f)$ is monic. Consider
                two morphism $g, h: A \to C'$ in $\cc$, and suppose
                that $f \circ g = f \circ k$. Then $F(f) \circ F(g) =
                F(f) \circ F(k) \implies F(g) = F(k)$, since $F(f)$ is
                monic. However, $F$ is faithful, so that $g = k$. Hence $f$ is monic as well.
            \end{description}  

            \item[$\bm{(ii)}$] 
            \begin{description}
                \item[$\bm{\implies}$] Suppose $C$ is initial in
                $\cc$. Let $D$ be an object in $\dd$. Then observe
                that, since $\cc$ and $\dd$ are equivalent, there
                exists an isomorphism $\theta: F(A) \to D$ for some
                object $A$ of $\cc$. Since $C$ is initial, we know
                that there exists a unique morphism $f_C: C \to A$.
                Hence $F(f_C): F(C)\to F(A)$. We then have that $F(f_c)
                \circ \theta : F(C) \to D$. Hence there exists a
                morphism from $F(C)$ to $D$. 

                Now suppose $f_1, f_2; F(C) \to D$. Then $\theta^{-1}
                \circ f_1, \theta^{-1}\circ f_2: F(C) \to F(A)$. Since
                $F$ is full, we know that there exist morphism $k_1,
                k_1: C \to A$ such that $F(k_1) = \theta^{-1}\circ
                f_1$ and $F(k_2) = \theta^{-1}\circ f_2$. However,
                since $C$ is initial, we see that $k_1 = k_2 = f_C$.
                Hence $f_1 = f_2$, so that there is exactly one
                morphism $f_1=f_2:F(C) \to D$. 

                Since $D$ was an arbitrary object of $\dd$, we have
                that $F(C)$ is initial. 
                
                \item[$\bm{\impliedby}$] 
                Suppose $F(C)$ is an initial object. Consider any
                object $C'$ of $\cc$. Then since $F(C)$ is initial, there exists a unique
                morphism $f: F(C) \to F(C')$. Since $F$ is full, we
                know that this corresponds with a morphism $k: C \to
                C'$ such that $F(k) = f$. Hence we have a unique
                morphism $k: C \to C'$. And since $C'$ was an 
                arbitrary object of $\cc$, we have that $C$ is
                initial, as desired. 
            \end{description}  
        \end{description}
    \end{prf}
    The proofs in which we proved $f$ to be an epimorphism, and for $C$ 
    to be a terminal object, are very similar. This proposition will soon be
    generalized, but this gives us insight into how useful the concept
    of equivalent categories truly is. 

    \begin{exercise}[Exercise 4.4.3]
        \textcolor{purple}{If $F: \cc \to \dd$ is full, faithful, and
        surjective on objects (each $D \in \dd$ is $D = F(C)$ for some
        $C$ in $\cc$), prove that there is an adjoint equivalence $(F,
        G, 1, \epsilon): \dd \to \cc$ with unit the identity (and
        thence that $G$ is a left-adjoint-right-inverse of $F$).
        }
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{solution}
        By Theorem 4.\ref{equivalence_theorem}, we know that an
        equivalence of categories necessarily induces an adjoint
        equivalence $(F, G, \eta, \epsilon)$. While we know that
        $\eta: G \circ F \cong I_\dd$ as a natural transformation, we
        now want to show that $\eta = I_\dd$, the identity natural
        transformation. 

        First recall what $\eta$ is. For any object $C$ of $\cc$, and
        any morphism $f: C \to G(D)$, we have that 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                C \arrow[r, "\eta_C"] \arrow[dr, swap, "f"] 
                &
                G(F(C)) \arrow[d, dashed, "G(f')"]\\
                & G(D) 
            \end{tikzcd}
            \hspace{1cm} 
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]

                D
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        Since $F$ is surjective, we know that $D = F(C')$ for some $C'
        \in \cc$. Hence $f': F(C) \to F(C')$. Since $F$ is full, we
        know that this corresponds to a morphism $g: C \to C'$ such
        that $F(g) = f'$.     
    \end{solution}

    \section{Adjoints on Preorders.}

    Interesting things happen when one applies adjoint concepts to
    functors between preorders; ones which preserve order in a special
    way. It's actually often the case where we have two mathematical
    structures involving chains of arrows which reverse when
    transferring between one and the other. We give such a concept a
    definition first, before introducing a theorem about such structures. 
     
    \begin{definition}
        Let $\pp$ and $\qqq$ be two preorders. If there exists functors 
        $F: \pp \to \qqq$ and $G:\qqq \to \pp$ such that 
        \[
            F(P) \le Q \iff P \le G(Q),  
        \]
        That is, there exists $f:F(P) \to Q$ if and only if there
        exists $g: P \to G(Q)$, then $F$ and $G$ are called a
        \textbf{monotone Galois connection}. On the other hand, 
        if we have that 
        \[
            F(P) \le Q \iff P \ge G(Q)
        \]
        then $F$ and $G$ are called a \textbf{antitone Galois
        connection}. 
    \end{definition}

    \begin{thm}
        Let $\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{Q}$ be two preorders, and suppose
        $F: \mathcal{P} \to \mathcal{Q}\op$ and
        $G:\mathcal{Q}\op \to \mathcal{P}$ are two order preserving 
        functors. Then $F$ is
        left adjoint to $G$ if and only if for all $P \in \mathcal{P}$
        and $Q \in \mathcal{Q}$ 
        \[
            F(P) \ge Q \iff P \le G(Q).
        \]
        Given such an adjunction, we then have that our unit
        establishes $P \le G(F(P))$ and the counit establishes $F(G(Q)) \le
        Q$. 
    \end{thm}

    \begin{prf}
        Observe that if $F$ is left adjoint to $G$, then we have the 
        bijection 
        \[
            \hom_{\mathcal{Q}\op}(F(P), Q) \cong \hom_{\mathcal{P}}(P, G(Q)
            )
        \]
        which gives rise to the desired correspondence; on the other
        hand, such a bijection gives rise to an adjunction. 
        With such an adjunction, we know that for each $P, Q$, there
        exist morphisms $\eta_P: P \to G(F(P))$ and $\epsilon_Q:
        F(G(Q)) \to Q$. Hence $P \le G(F(P))$  and $F(G(Q)) \ge Q$. 
    \end{prf}

    The above theorem came out of the observation that there is a
    connection between fields, their subfields, and their groups of
    automorphisms, an observation which arises in Galois Theory.
    The goal of Galois Theory is to understand polynomials and their
    roots; when they can be factorized, when and where we can find
    their roots. The study of Galois groups is now used widely in
    number theory. For example, part of Andrew Wiles' work in proving
    Fermat's Last Theorem involved Galois representations.

    
    It was this theorem, rooted in Galois Theory, that motivated the
    Theorem 4.\ref{galois_connections} at the beginning of this
    section. 
    The Fundamental Theorem
    of Galois Theory is simply a \textit{stronger}, special case, since in
    this case, the functors are literally inverses of each other. The
    theorem we introduced, however, simply requires the functors to be
    adjoints of one another. 

    \begin{example}
        Let $U, V$ be sets, and observe that their power sets $\mathcal{P}
        (U)$ and $\mathcal{P}(V)$ form categories; specifically,
        preorders, ordered by set inclusion. 

        Suppose $f: U \to V$ is a function in \textbf{Set}. Then $f$
        induces a functor $f_*: \mathcal{P}(U) \to \mathcal{P}(V)$,
        where 
        \[
            f_*(X) = \{f(x) \mid x \in X\}.
        \]
        Note that if $X\subset X'$, then $f_*(X) \subset f_*(X')$.
        Hence this is an order-preserving functor. Now observe that
        $f$ also induces a functor $f^*:
        \mathcal{P}(V) \to \mathcal{P}(U)$ where 
        \[
            f^*(Y) = \{x \mid f(x) \in Y\}.
        \] 
        Note that this also preserves order. In addition, we have that if 
        $f_*(X) \le Y$, then this holds if  and only if $f(X) \subset
        Y$. We then have that this holds if and only if $X \subset
        f_*(Y)$, Hence we have a Galois connection, so that we may apply 
        Theorem 4.\ref{galois_connections} to conclude that $f_*$ is
        left adjoint to $f^*$.  
    \end{example}





    \begin{exercise}[4.5.2]
        \textcolor{purple}{In a Galois connection between posets, show
        that the subset $\{p \mid p = R(L(p))\}$ of $P$ equals $\{p
        \mid p = R(q) \text{ for some } q\}$ and gives a bijection
        from this set to the subset $\{q \mid q = L(R(q))\}$ of $Q$.
        What are these sets in the case of a group of automorphisms? 
        Does this generalize to an arbitrary adjunction?
        }
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{solution}
        In terms of notation, we have that $L: P \to Q\op$ and $R:
        Q\op \to P$. In addition, let $P_1 = \{p \in P \mid p =
        R(L(p))\}$, $P_2 = \{p \in P \mid p = R(q) \text{ for some
        } q \}$ and $Q' = \{q \in Q \mid q=  L(R(q))\}$.
        
        Now let $p \in P$ be such that $p = R(L(p))$. 
        Then clearly $p = R(q)$ for some $q \in Q$, so that $P_1
        \subset P_2$. Now suppose $p = R(q)$ for some $q$. Since this
        is a Galois connection, we have an adjunction, so that $q$ is
        isomorphic to some object $L(p')$. However, an isomorphism in
        a partially ordered category implies equality. Therefore $q =
        L(p')$ so that $p = R(L(p'))$. 
    \end{solution}

    \section{Exponential Objects and Cartesian Closed Categories.}
    Before we introduce the notion of cartesian closed category, we 
    begin with a preliminary proposition. 

    \begin{proposition}
        Suppose $\cc$ is a category, and consider the functors 
        \[
            U: C \to \textbf{1} \qquad \Delta: \cc \to \cc \times \cc.
        \]
        where $\textbf{1}$ is the one object category.
        \begin{description}
            \item[$\bm{(i)}$] If $U$ has a left adjoint, then 
            $\cc$ has an initial object.   

            \item[$\bm{(ii)}$] If $\Delta$ has a left adjoint, then
            $\cc$ has finite coproducts.

            \item[$\bm{(iii)}$] If $U$ has a right adjoint, then $\cc$
            has a terminal object. 

            \item[$\bm{(iv)}$] If $\Delta$ has a right adjoint, then 
            $\cc$ has finite products.  
        \end{description}
    \end{proposition}
    The proof is a straightforward, although tedious, so we sketch it
    out as follows. 

    \begin{prf}
        
    \textcolor{RedViolet}{\textbf{Adjoints of $\bm{U}.$}}
    First, let $F: \textbf{1} \to \cc$ be a left adjoint of $U$. Suppose
    $F(1) = I$ in $\cc$. Then for any $C \in \cc$, we have the bijection
    $\hom_{\cc}(F(1), C) \cong \hom_{\textbf{1}}(1, U(C))$ which
    implies that
    \[ 
        \hom_{\cc}(I, C) 
        \cong \hom_{\textbf{1}}(1, 1).
    \]
    In other words, for each object $C$, there is exactly one and only
    one morphism $i_C: I \to C$, which makes $I$ an initial object. 
    
    On
    the other hand, suppose $G: {1} \to \cc$ is a right adjoint of
    $U$. Then if $G(1) = T$, we have the bijection 
    $\hom_{\textbf{1}}(U(C), 1) \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, G(1))$
    which implies that 
    \[
        \hom_{\textbf{1}}(1, 1) \cong \hom_{\cc}(C, T)
    \]
    so that for each object $C$ there exists a unique morphism $t_C: C
    \to T$, which makes $T$ a terminal object. Hence left and right
    adjoints guarantee the existence of initial and terminal objects.\\
    \\
    \textcolor{RedViolet}{\textbf{Adjoints of $\bm{\Delta}$.}}
    Let $F: \cc \times \cc \to \cc$ be a left adjoint of $\Delta$, so
    that we have the relation
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            \cc \times \cc \arrow[r, shift left=0.6ex,"F"] & \cc 
            \arrow[l,shift right =-0.6ex, "\Delta"]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    Then for each object $(A, B) \in \cc \times \cc$, we have the
    morphism $\eta_{(A,B)}: (A, B) \to \Delta(F(A,B))$, which we can 
    rewrite as $\eta_{(A,B)}: (A, B) \to (F(A,B), F(A,B))$.
    We can put this into a universal diagram 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            (A, B) \arrow[r, "\eta_{(A,B)}"] 
            \arrow[dr, swap, "f"]
            & (F(A, B), F(A,B)) 
            \arrow[d, dashed, "{(g' , g')}"]
            \\
            & (C, D)
        \end{tikzcd}
        \hspace{1cm}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            (A, B) \arrow[r, "{(i,j)}"]
            \arrow[dr,swap, "f"]
            & (A \amalg B, A \amalg B) 
            \arrow[d, dashed, "{(f', f')}"]
            \\
            & (C, D) 
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    where the diagram on the right is the coproduct diagram of $A \times
    B$. Since both of the pairs $\Big((F(A,B), F(A,B)), \eta_{(A,B)}\Big)$ 
    and $\Big((A\times B, A \times B), (\pi_A, \pi_B)\Big)$ are universal
    from $(A, B)$ to $\Delta$, they must be isomorphic. As two
    universal objects are isomorphic, we therefore have, 
    \[
        F(A, B) \cong A \amalg B
    \]
    so that a left adjoint gives rise to products. 
    

    Let $G: \cc \times \cc \to \cc$ be a right adjoint of $\Delta$, so
    that we have 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            \cc \arrow[r, shift left=0.6ex,"\Delta"] & \cc \times \cc
            \arrow[l,shift right =-0.6ex, "G"]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    The adjunction gives rise to a universal morphism
    $\epsilon_{(A,B)}: \Delta(G(A,B)) \to (A,B)$, which we can rewrite
    as $\epsilon_{(A,B)}: (G(A,B), G(A,B)) \to (A,B)$. We then have
    the diagram 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            (A, B) 
            & (G(A, B), G(A,B)) 
            \arrow[l, swap, "\epsilon_{(A,B)}"] 
            \\
            & (C, D) \arrow[ul, "f"]
            \arrow[u, dashed, swap, "{(g' , g')}"]
        \end{tikzcd}
        \hspace{1cm}
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
            (A, B) 
            & (A \times B, A \times B) 
            \arrow[l, swap, "{(\pi_A, \pi_B)}"]
            \\
            & (C, D) 
            \arrow[ul, "f"]
            \arrow[u, swap, dashed, "{(f', f')}"]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    where the diagram on the right is the product diagram of $A \times B$. 
    Thus we see that\\
    $\Big((G(A,B), G(A, B)), \epsilon_{(A,B)}\Big)$ 
    and $\Big((A\times B, A \times
    B), (\pi_A, \pi_B)\Big)$ are both universal from $\Delta$ to $(A, B)$.
    As universal objects from the same construction are isomorphic, we
    have that 
    \[
        G(A, B) \cong A \times B
    \]
    so that this adjunction gives rise to coproducts. 
    \end{prf}
    
    \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{Thus if we have left and right adjoints
    of the functors $U$ and $\Delta$, we get intial and terminal
    objects as 
    well as finite products and coproducts. Note, however, that finite
    products require (and give rise to) initial objects, and similarly
    that finite coproducts require (and give rise to) terminal
    objects.} 

    Next, we make the following definition. 
    \begin{definition}
        Let $\cc$ be a category with finite products. Suppose $Y, Z$ are 
        objects in $\cc$. We say $Z^Y$ is an \textbf{exponent object} in
        $\cc$ if there exists a morphism $\textbf{eval}: (Z^Y \times Y)
        \to Z$ which is universal from $-\times Y: \cc \to \cc$ to the
        object $Z$. 

        Visually, this translates into requiring that the following
        diagram commutes. 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                Z & Z^Y \times Y \arrow[l, swap, "{\textbf{eval}}"]\\
                & X \times Y \arrow[ul, "g"] 
                \arrow[u, swap, dashed, "{(h, \text{id}_Y)}"]
            \end{tikzcd}
            \hspace{1cm}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                Z^Y \\
                X \arrow[u, dashed, swap, "h"]
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
    \end{definition}
    \textcolor{Purple}{Hence, every morphism,
    with the domain being any product with $\bm{Y}$, and codomain being
    $\bm{Z}$, uniquely factors through $\bm{Z^Y \times Y}$.}

    Here, we'll stop and look at a pretty cool real world example.

    \begin{example}
        Consider the category \textbf{Set}. Then we know that, for any
        two given objects $Y$ and $Z$, we can form a set of functions 
        between the objects:
        \[
            \hom_{\textbf{Set}}(Y, Z).
        \]
        Thus, the collection of morphisms from sets $Y$ to $Z$ is
        \textit{itself a set}, and hence a member of \textbf{Set}.
        Now let $A$ be any object in $\textbf{Set}$, and let 
        \[
            X = \{f \in \textbf{Set} \mid f: A \times Y \to Z\}.            
        \]
        Define $\textbf{eval}: \hom_{\textbf{Set}}(Y, Z)\times Y \to
        Z$ as, who would've guessed, the evaluation:
        \[
            \textbf{eval}(f(y), y') = f(y').
        \] 
        Now for each $a \in A$, we can define a function $g_a: X
        \times Y \to Z$ where for each $f: A \times Y \to Z$
        \[
            g_a(f, y') = f(a, y') \in Z
        \]
        so this is sort of a "double" evaluation function.
        Then for every such $g_a$, there exists a unique $h_a: X \to
        \hom_{\textbf{Set}}(Y, Z)$ where for each $f: A \times Y \to Z$
        \[ 
            h_a(f) = f(a, y): Y \to Z.
        \] 
        Thus we get the following commutative diagram:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                Z & \hom_{\textbf{Set}}(Y, Z) \times Y \arrow[l, swap, "
                {\textbf{eval}}"]\\
                & X \times Y \arrow[ul, "g_a"] 
                \arrow[u, swap, dashed, "{(h_a, \text{id}_Y)}"]
            \end{tikzcd}
            \hspace{1cm}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                Z^Y \\
                X \arrow[u, dashed, swap, "h_a"]
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        What is this? What's really going on and why do we care?\\
        \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{This construction relates to a concept in
        computer science called
        \textbf{currying}. Applied category theory in computer science
        generally works in \textbf{Set}, so that's why this idea
        transfers over.
        \\
        \\
        The idea is: given a multivariable function, do we evaluate
        all arguments at once, or evaluate just one argument, thereby
        sending a function to another function? Both methods can offer 
        advantages. But universality tells us that, in the end, they're the same thing.}

        We can think of $X \times Y$ as being elements $(f(a, y),
        y')$ where $f: A \times Y \to Z$. Then $h$ evaluates $f(a',y)$ for
        some $a'$, thus sending the function $f: A \times Y \to Z$ to the 
        function $f:Y \to Z$. That is, 
        \[
            (h \times \id_y) \circ \big( (f(a, y), y') \big) = (f(a', y), 
            y').
        \]
        Finally, $\textbf{eval}$ evaluates $f(a', y)$
        at $y'$, returning an object in $Z$.

        Alternatively, we can start with the object $(f(a, y), y')$, and
        simply act on $g$, which evaluates it at both $a'$ and $y'$,
        returning the same object $f(a', y')$. 
        Thus in the realm of computer science, we may think of the
        morphisms $(h, \id_y)$, $g$ and \textbf{eval} as commands, as this
        is how currying is often done. 

        The universality of this constructions states that both methods
        are the same; that is, 
        \[
            g = \textbf{eval}\circ (h \times \id_Y).
        \]

        Since we started with arbitrary objects in \textbf{Set}, the
        consequence for computer science is that we can always curry
        these functions. Typically what is curried are types, such as 
        \textbf{Bool} or \textbf{Int}. 
    \end{example}

    In an arbitrary category of finite products, the exponential
    object is just a generalization of currying. But in \textbf{Set},
    we see that an exponential object exists for any two pairs of
    sets. Thus, can we turn this exponential assignment into a
    functor? Yes,we can. 

    \begin{definition}
        Let $\cc$ have finite products and exponential objects for
        every pair of objects. Then for each $Y$ in $\cc$ we can create an 
        \textbf{exponential functor} $E^Y: \cc \to \cc$ as follows. 
        \begin{description}
            \item[Objects.] For each $Z \in \cc$, we define $E^Y(Z) =
            Z^Y$. 

            \item[Morphisms.] Let $f: A \to B$ be in $\cc$. Then we 
            note that we have the following diagrams. 
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    A & A^Y \times Y \arrow[l, swap, Red,
                    "{\textbf{eval}_A}"]\\
                    & X \times Y \arrow[ul, "g"] 
                    \arrow[u, swap, dashed, "{(h, \text{id}_Y)}"]
                \end{tikzcd}
                \hspace{0.5cm}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    A^Y \\
                    X \arrow[u, dashed, swap, "h"]
                \end{tikzcd}
                \hspace{1cm}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    B & B^Y \times Y \arrow[l, swap, RoyalBlue,
                     "{\textbf{eval}_B}"]\\
                    & X \times Y \arrow[ul, "g'"] 
                    \arrow[u, swap, dashed, "{(h', \text{id}_Y)}"]
                \end{tikzcd}
                \hspace{0.5cm}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    B^Y \\
                    X \arrow[u, dashed, swap, "h'"]
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            Now observe that we can form the morphism $f \circ
            \textcolor{Red}{\textbf{eval}_A} : A^Y \times Y \to B$. 
            Hence by universality
            of $B^Y$, there exists a unique morphism $h': A^Y \to B^Y$.
            Diagramatically, we take the above diagram on the right, and
            replace $X$ with $A^Y$ and $g$ with $f \circ \textbf{eval}_A$.
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    B & B^Y \times Y \arrow[l, swap, RoyalBlue, 
                    "{\textbf{eval}_B}"]\\
                    & A^Y \times Y 
                    \arrow
                    [ul, "f \circ \textcolor{Red}{\textbf{eval}_A}"] 
                    \arrow[u, swap, dashed, "{(h', \text{id}_Y)}"]
                \end{tikzcd}
                \hspace{0.5cm}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    B^Y \\
                    A^Y \arrow[u, dashed, swap, "h'"]
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            Since $h$ exists if $f: A \to B$ exists, we therefore define 
            \[
                E^Y(f: A \to B) = h': A^Y \to B^Y
            \]
            where $h'$ is the unique morphism such that 
            \[
                f \circ \textcolor{Red}{\textbf{eval}_A}
                = \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\textbf{eval}_A} \circ (h', \id_Y).
            \]
        \end{description}    
    \end{definition}
    Note that there's one more cool connection here. If we have a
    category 
    with finite products, and one in which exponential objects exist,
    then we have a morphism $\textbf{eval}_A: A^Y \times Y
    \to A$ which is universal from the functor $-\times Y: \cc \to
    \cc$ 
    to $A$.
    \textbf{Therefore, this is a counit!} There's an adjunction hiding
    here. 

    \begin{proposition}
        Let $\cc$ be a category with finite products and exponential
        objects. Let $Y$ be an object, and define the functors 
        \begin{align*}
            P_Y &= (-) \times Y: \cc \to \cc\\
            E^Y &= (-)^Y: \cc \to \cc.
        \end{align*}
        Then $E^Y$ is right adjoint to $P_Y$ for every $Y \in \cc$.
        Therefore, 
        \[
            \hom_{\cc}(X \times Y, Z) \cong \hom_{\cc}(X, Z^Y)
        \]
        which is natural for all objects $X, Y, Z \in \cc$. 
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{prf}
        For each object $A \in \cc$, the exponential object gives rise
        to a universal morphism $\textbf{eval}_A: A^Y \times Y \to A$.
        So on one hand, we get the diagram on the left
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]

        but on the other hand, the diagram on the right is exactly
        equivalent. Hence we see that $\textbf{eval}$ is actually a
        counit $\epsilon_A: P_Y(E^Y(A)) \to A$. Since such a counit
        exists for each $A$, this gives rise to an adjunction, so that
        $E^Y$ is right adjoint to $P_Y$ for every object $Y$ in $\cc$.
    \end{prf}

    Finally, we have everything we need to move onto to the main point
    of this section. 

    \begin{definition}
        Let $\cc$ be a category. We say $\cc$ is a \textbf{cartesian closed 
        category} if the functors 
        \[
            U: \textbf{C} \to \textbf{1} 
            \qquad
            \Delta: \cc \to \cc  \times \cc 
            \qquad 
            P_Y = (-)\times Y: \cc \to \cc
        \]
        have right adjoints. In other words, $\cc$ is 
        \textbf{cartesian closed} if 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[1.] There exists a terminal object $T$ 
            \item[2.] $\cc$ has finite products 
            \item[3.] An exponential object $A^Y$ for every $A \in
            \cc$ for all $Y$.   
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}

    Thus the work we just did was used in showing that our
    three-bullet point list is another definition of a cartesian
    closed category. Often, only one definition or the other is
    offered, and it's not trivial how they're equivalent, so it can be
    confusing. Thus our work shows that either definition is
    equivalent. 

    Some examples include \textbf{Set}, which we already dealt with.
    \textbf{Set} has a terminal object (empty set), has finite
    products, and has an exponential object. More interesting is
    \textbf{Cat}, which is catesian closed. In this case, \textbf{1}
    is the terminal object, \textbf{Cat} is closed under finite
    products, and the exponential object exists. In this case,
    $\cc^{\bb}$ is simply the functor category! 

    \textcolor{MidnightBlue}{At first, it seemed silly to define
    $\cc^\bb$ as the category of functors \textit{from} $\bb$ to
    $\cc$, since it seemed that it ought to be denoted $\bb^\cc$.
    However, we see that this was really just because of the concept
    of exponentials, which isn't known when being introduced functor
    categories.}
    
    \begin{exercise}[Exercise 4.6.1]
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textcolor{purple}{If 
            $U$ is any set, show that the preorder
            $\mathcal{P}(U)$ of all subsets of $U$ is a cartesian 
            closed category.}

            \item \textcolor{purple}{
            Show that any Boolean algebra, regarded as a
            preorder, is cartesian closed.}
        \end{enumerate}
        \vspace{-0.8cm}
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{solution}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item To show that $\mathcal{P}(U)$ is cartesian closed, 
            we simply check the criteria. First, $\mathcal{P}(U)$ contains 
            a terminal object; since every $X \in \mathcal{P}(U)$ is a
            subset of $U$, we have that there exists a unique 
            morphism $t_X: X \to U$. 

            In addition, we have finite products. Let $A, B$ be two
            elements of $\mathcal{P}(U)$. Then if $D \le A$ and $D \le
            B$, we have that $D \le A \cap B$. Hence the following
            diagram commutes. 
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    & \arrow[dl, swap, "f"] D \arrow[d, dashed, "h"]
                    \arrow[dr, "g"]& \\
                    A & \arrow[l, "i"] A \cap B \arrow[r, swap, "j"] & B 
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            Hence we see  that $\cap$ is actually a product in our 
            preorder! Since we may take finite intersections in 
            $\mathcal{P}(U)$, we have finite "products".
            
            Finally, observe that the left diagram 
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    A & A^Y \times Y \arrow[l, swap,
                    "{\textbf{eval}_A}"]\\
                    & X \times Y \arrow[ul, "g"] 
                    \arrow[u, swap, dashed, "{(h, \text{id}_Y)}"]
                \end{tikzcd}
                \hspace{1cm}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    A & A^Y \cap Y \arrow[l, swap,
                    "i"]\\
                    & X \cap Y \arrow[ul, "g"] 
                    \arrow[u, swap, dashed, "h"]
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            becomes the diagram on the right in this category. Here 
            we denote $i$ has the inclusion.
            Now
            suppose that $g: X \cap Y \to A$, meaning that $X \cap Y \le A$.
            Then $X \le A$, so  that there exists 
            a morphism $h: X \to A^Y = X \to A$. Hence we get the
            diagram 
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    A & A \cap Y \arrow[l, swap,
                    "i"]\\
                    & X \cap Y \arrow[ul, "g"] 
                    \arrow[u, swap, dashed, "h"]
                \end{tikzcd}
                \hspace{1cm}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.4cm, row sep = 1.4cm]
                    A \\
                    X \arrow[u, "h"]
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            and from this perspective, we see that $A^Y = A$. Hence
            exponentials trivially exist in our preorder. 

            Since $\mathcal{P}(U)$ contains a terminal object, finite
            products, and exponential objects, we have that any
            preorder $\mathcal{P}(U)$ is cartesian closed. 

            Obviously wrong, so what's the exponential?
        \end{enumerate}
